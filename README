The Topic Model Analyzer (TMA) is a simple tool for exploring and analyzing your real-world data with modern topic models. 
Using a modern, javascript-enabled web-browser (preferably not IE, yet...), navigate to http://geordi.cs.uiowa.edu/tma and begin using TMA on any reasonably sized dataset.
NOTE: To prevent security vulnerabilities, the online TMA has vastly reduced functionality.

TMA is distributed under GPL 3.0.

See the TMA wiki https://github.com/cjrd/TMA/wiki for documentation, tutorials, and implementation details.
