hi, all
I have found a confusing problem about alpha prediction. The iteration
equation is
alpha_new = alpha_old - H(alpha)^{-1}g(alpha)
However, in blei's code, I saw:
log_a = log_a - df/(d2f * a + df);
df represent the first derivate of log likelihood function according to
alpha
d2f represent the second derivate of log likelihood function according to
alpha
Why blei use log(alpha) to replace alpha?
Anyone can give me some explanation?
Best regards,
Sinerely,
boby
