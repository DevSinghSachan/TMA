Suhas,
regarding your intuition in Q1. I don't think this holds.  Depending on
K, settings on priors and initialization you may end up with different
topics. They might even be orthogonal. Think of it as organizing colored
shapes. You may organize them by color, or alternatively by shape, you
cant say which is the sub topic or super topic. .oO( unfortunately with
unsupervised learning you may get half colored, half shaped topics)
If the super-sub topic relationship is important to you, I would look at
the Pachinko allocation papers.
Cheers,
Laura
