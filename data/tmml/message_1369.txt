Hello everyone:
I am doing some test via LDA and got some problems about it, you see it is
totally unsupervised, right? However words in text is various, should you
run it on various words or just narrow the words down into some specific
ones? Will that be more secure as some "bad" words may exsits in your
topics?
More detail, you see, as ? is a matrix of [topic: word, word,....,word],
right? how to choose the words? just to use the words as much as you get
