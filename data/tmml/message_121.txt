Hi list,
Does anyone on this list have successfully applied the code of CTM ?
I have some problems about the code of CTM.
In the model estimating step, the parameter "var->lambda" is K-vector, but only the anterior K-1 iterms have been  iteratively computed, and the last iterm is set with zero.
And in my experiment, the ouput file "final-lambda.dat" and "final-nu.dat" are D*K matirxs, but the last colum is zero.
In the infering step, the output file "corpus-word-assgn.dat", all the words get the bigest probabilities at the K topic.
Could anyone tell me wether it is right? Why the cycle is K-1 ,but not K?
Thanks
