Hello Yiliang,
As you increase the number of topics you will eventually over-fit the data,
This tends to cause perplexity increase on the held out set.
If you optimize the hyper parameters during the sampling with a large number of topics some of them will have a prior approaching 0, thus reducing the over fitting (try Mallet).
