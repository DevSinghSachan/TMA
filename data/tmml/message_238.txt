Dear friends:
I have read the HDP matlab code by Yee. And I am trying to use HDP to
analysis documents.
My idea is as follow,  each word as a point, each document(paper) as a
vector of counts of vocabulary, and collection of documents as a matrix,
each row vector is just a vector of document.
When use crf sampling, first sample table(document) associate with word,
then sample class associate with table(document).
Of course,the number of tables will change within different iteration of
sampling, so will the number of documents, and finally reach a stable number
of table(document), which is (or approximately) the number of
document(paper) .
I am not sure whether this representaion is reasonable.
So, could anyone who experienced with HDP give me some advice?
Thank you very much.
