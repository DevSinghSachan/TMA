Dear all,
I am a MS student at KAIST, Korea.
I am currently studying on LDA and read the LDA paper (Blei et al., 2003)
several times.
But I did not understand some parts of it.
I have some questions about LDA. Do anyone knows.
1. p(w|a) and alpha are two parameters which control LDA.
But these are mere parameters, not variables.
Why do they appear in the graphical model of LDA?
And why didn't they appear in the previous models(unigral, mixture of
unigram,...)?
2. I think alpha values should be composed of A by 1 vector.
But source code in your web has it as a scalar variable.
I saw some answers mentioning exchangeability from here.
But I still can't understand it.
Could you please give me link or some materials which can help me?
3. In a graphical model of simple unigram model and others,
we can know there are N number of words in each of M documents.
But according to the rule of graphical model,
it seems like that number N is fixed for all M documents
But it seems rear because all M documents have same N words.
Is number N fixed? or variable?
Can we rewrite N as Ni? (i is index for M documents)
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Regards, BSR
