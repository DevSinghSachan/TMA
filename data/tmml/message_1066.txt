I am applying the topic modeling to a different kind of data.
My question may sound trivial (pls forgive me) but i have been stuck in trying to prepare my input files to implement the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process code you referred to.
My confusion? specifically is with the data format.
"The data is a file where each line is of the form:
[M] [term_1]:[count] [term_2]:[count] ...? [term_N]:[count]
where [M] is the number of unique terms in the document, and the
[count] associated with each term is how many times that term appeared
in the document."
My understanding so far about representing documents in the vector-space model is that the 'words' are rows while the 'documents' are columns (word-documents?frequency matrix).?Therefore each row?of the matrix?are occurrence of word i in all the documents in the j colums.
But the expression: "where [M] is the number of unique terms in THE DOCUMENT, and the [count] associated with each term is how many times that term appeared
in THE DOCUMENT."- makes it sound like the rows of the matrix are documents while the columns are the the words.
Is [M] the total number of? non-zero entries of the rows OR it is the sum of the values in the non-zero cells?
Could you please attach a piece of the a corpus already in the LDA-C format . Also any other required input file. I can use these as template for preparing my data to use with the code you have provided.
Thanks for all you do.
