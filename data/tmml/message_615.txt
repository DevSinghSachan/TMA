Yes, it does. For a better explanation, see page 994:
"Thus each word is generated from a single topic, and different words in a
document may be generated from different topics. Each document is
represented as a list of mixing proportions for these mixture components and
thereby reduced to a probability distribution on a fixed set of topics. This
distribution is the `reduced description' associated with the document."
