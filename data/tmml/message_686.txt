Hi, Experts
some good answers about finding the optimal K were given to me. Laura
Dietz and David Blei pointed to the use of Hierarchical Direchlet
Processes. I studied the papers and the software for this type of
inference. So far so confused... My Problem with the described gibbs
samplers is that i miss some description about the update/iteration
algorithm provided in some papers about LDA.
Can someone point me to a paper where an implementation schema or the
conrete algorithm is listed. Main Problem is that i do not understand
when to update / alter K in the sampling process. Since i'm new to that
field its difficult for me to derive an algorithm from the papers at
this page (+ that i have to use the model in Java and need to implement it):

Thank you all
