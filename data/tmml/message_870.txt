hi bin
another option is to use supervised LDA in the multinomial regression
setting.  chong wang, fei--fei li, and i wrote about this in the
context of image classification,
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/WangBleiFeiFei2009.pdf
chong has placed code on-line,
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chongw/slda/index.html
for a more general perspective on supervised LDA, jon mcauliffe and i
recently submitted this paper to statistical science:
