Thanks for trying out a very experimental package =).  Oops, I had some
changes which had not yet been committed.  If you get a fresh copy from svn
it should compile just fine, otherwise you will have to wait for r-forge to
rebuild the package (which will take at most a day, but probably less).
Cheers,
Jonathan
