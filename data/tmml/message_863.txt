Hi all,
I am currently working on a project in which we assume that a user's
knowledge of a subject matter domain can be characterized as a distribution
over topics and then use LDA topic modeling to attempt to infer changes in
knowledge as they engage in reading over the web. We then validate the
predictions of the model against observed pre- and post-test scores.
I've read much of the well-known LDA work, but I was curious if anyone had
any pointers to work/papers that specifically are looking at modeling latent
knowledge using topic models (or other probabilistic models). I've been
searching a great deal, but I am unsure if I am missing some important work
or if this specific angle hasn't been well-explored. Perhaps the closest
thing that I've seen so far are that attempt to infer things such as
political preferences using topic model similarity to reference texts (e.g.
Das 2009 and Yano 2009).
Thanks!
