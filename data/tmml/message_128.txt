Does anyone on this list know of work that encourages the topic
distributions (e.g. the K multinomials in an LDA model with K topics) to
be different from each other in some sense?  In standard LDA, the topics
are not explicitly
required to be distinct.  But in some applications it might be advantageous
for them to be somewhat 'orthogonal'.  Any pointers will be appreciated.
Thank you.
