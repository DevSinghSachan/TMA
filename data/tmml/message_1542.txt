Hi all,
Say that you have a set of users, and each user has collected some set of
items. So for a music recommendation system a user is someone who downloads
songs from certain artists, and they can be represented as a multiset (since
you can download multiple songs from the same artist) of artists.
Would it be feasible to represent each "topic" as a probability distribution
of artists (so a 'topic' here roughly represents a genre of music) and each
user has a probability distribution of genres (representing the 'tastes' of
a user). Then we can model a user's choice of what to download as: randomly
choose from its set of genres a genre, then from this genre randomly choose
an artist. This generative model of users downloading songs seems to be
directly analogous to LDA where a user is a document and an artist is a word
and a topic is a genre.
It seems like dynamic topic modeling could apply as well (if you like Eminem
and Lil Wayne now, you would have liked Run DMC in the early 90s) or
correlated topic modeling (someone who likes metal isn't very likely to
enjoy hip-hop perhaps).
Once we have estimated the most likely distributions on our k genres and on
our users, we could generate a "recommendation list" for a user by finding
the most likely artists that a user will download based on the model and
ordering them by likelihood (throwing out artists that a user has already
downloaded).
What do you guys think?
Harry
