Hello,
"Model" is the directory of a model you trained using lda est, while
"name" is the name of the files to be created (likelihood file and
gamma file).
You have to create the vocabulary file on your own when creating the
feature matrix.
1000 beta files?
There's one beta file, but there are many words and many topics, so
it's usually huge.
Best regards,
Matteo Dimai
