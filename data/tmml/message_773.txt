Hello,
Thanks for your help.
I also read the same concern in CTM model but later found the same paper by
David Mimno. I think the blocked Gibbs sampling is doable for the non
conjugancy issue, and we may not have to rely on the variational methods.
Sincerely,
Jiafeng

Hi,
I did also read the similar concern in DTM moidels. But then have a look
at this "Gibbs Sampling for Logistic Normal Topic Models with Graph-Based
Priors" by David Mimno which has non conjugancy issues due to logistic
normal and multinomial but still uses a sampling based method. I do not know
if it is always good to use variational methods if we have non conjugancy
issues. Hope some one else can talk about this in details.
Sincerely
Tanmoy
