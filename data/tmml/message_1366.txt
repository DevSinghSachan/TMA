i worked on this last summer, and used LDA on
70k short docs.  i estimated that document similarity
(using topic proportions as the feature vector) was
only 2.5X stronger at predicting similarity than randomly
pairing docs.
if you search the archives here, there was a
thread on document length a couple months (?) back.
iirc, somebody has had good luck with twitter data.
