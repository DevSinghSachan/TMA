Hi, Dave
Thank you. Indeed the paper on IDF and LDA has several flaws. My main
reserve is with the use of IDF, a global weight that, to some extent, was
a fair starting point in IR models. Today it is well known that IDF is an
RSJ weight in the absence of relevance information
(http://www.miislita.com/information-retrieval-tutorial/information-retrieval-probabilistic-model-tutorial.pdf).
So when we add IDF to the mix we are back to square one and to the term
independence assumption.
My main concern with IDF itself is that it presumes that the
discriminatory power of a term (term specificity) is unique and
independent from other terms in the same query or in a collection. A model
that uses IDF is incorporating these assumptions.
At the 2009 SIDIM XXIV conference,
http://sidim.uprh.edu/libroSIDIM2009.pdf, we presented a model for
conditional specificity (conditional IDF). Slides can be provided.
