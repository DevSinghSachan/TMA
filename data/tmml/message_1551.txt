Dear All,??kindly spare a moment to chip
in on these HDP related issues which I have been trying to resolve while learning the concept using the paper and the code in .
??Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (with Split-Merge
Operations) by Chong Wang
and David Blei for topic modeling. The default
parameters were used. The C++ Code is executed on a windows environment.
?I have extracted features (words) from 48 video clips (treated as documents), represented them in the LDA-C format and used the data in the HDP code.
Here are my observations/questions I need help on.
1. In the directory of training results, there
are nine .bin files and a tenth .bin file named mode.bin.
Question: ?(a) which of these is the ?saved_model? to be
used for inference?
(b) in the mode-word-assignments.dat I obsered
that the t-colum (which I assume to mean table) only ranged between 0 and 3.
Does that imply there are 4 tables in most occupied or 4 tables at the end of
the assignments? This confuses me because the last entry in the state.log file
shows num.tables as 161.!
2. In the state.log file I have probabilities
like -368259.47534, etc. These log probabilities don?t make sense to me and I wonder
what can be inferred from them.
3. The last entry in the state.log file is
this:
time ?? ? ?iter
??num.topics
?num.tables ?likelihood ??????? ?gamma ??alpha
?????split merge trial
371.00 ?00999? ?0032 ??? ? ? ??00161
????-343832.11109 ??1.00000
?1.00000 ????0 ???0 ???0
I interpret this to mean that after the 999th
iteration, the algorithm had discovered 32 topics, assigned a total of 161 tables.
Question: Likelihood???? I cannot interpret. Also
should I leave the gamma and alpha values at the default values or it need to
change based on my data.
4. PRINTING TOPICS
The README document says:
?A R script (print.topics.R) is included to
print topics. Make sure it is executable.
For example print.topics.R mode-topics.dat
vocab.dat topics.dat 10.
I have installed R on my system but I cannot
find the above mentioned script.
Question: How?
do I ?view the results of this HDP
program in R? (graphically?), particularly the print.topics.R
Thanks
