Hi all:
I am a freshman in LDA and I want to use it in my work,but I met some trouble
recently, espically about the parameters. I wish I could receive your help. Here
are the problems:
1. In variational EM, what is the relationship between the \gamma, \phi and
\alpha, \beta. What's more, I run the LDA-c code recently(thanks for PAwan and
Blei), but I don't know what the output means, espcially how can I get P(topic)(
also can be named by \theta ) distribution?
2. I also tried a Gibbs sampling based method to inference the model as shown by
"Finding scientific topics". I have seen a few of Gibbs sampling based method for
LDA in text mining area, unfortunately they all set the value of \alpha and \beta
previouly, without a learning process. While if I use the LDA in other areas, the
corresponding \alpha and \beta may be different from text area. Are there any
methods that can be used to training the parameters (\alpha and \beta) in Gibbs
sampling?
3 If we have known the value of \alpha and \beta, is there any method to learn
a right K (the number of topics)?
These questions may be too naive,but I really have no idea about variational
methods and Gibbs sampling.
Thank you very much! All the best!
