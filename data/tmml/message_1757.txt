Hi, Radim
what new york times data do you use? mine is
New York Times:
The New York Times (NYT) dataset contains about 1.8 million documents, with about 461 million tokens and a vocabulary size of 8,000. These articles are from the years 1987 to 2007,
the vocab is at http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chongw/nyt-vocab.dat
for kappa=0.8, tau0=1, and batchsize=500, i got topics like this
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chongw/nyt-topics.txt
i also found that if the number of documents is small, the online algorithm doesn't work well.
best
chong
