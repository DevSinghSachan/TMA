Does anyone have experience or other observations on clustering
per-document topic vectors produced by application of topic modeling to
a document collection, particularly hard-assignment, hierarchical
clustering (e.g., producing a dendogram), from which an analyst might
more easily assess various partitions of the documents (e.g., so that an
analyst can cut the dendogram to give a three-cluster partition of the
documents and compare this to four- and five- cluster partitions
produced by different cuts)? Best, Doug
