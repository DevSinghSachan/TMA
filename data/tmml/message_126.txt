dear cao juan,
the code works using the minimal representation of the logistic
normal (LN).  the idea is to parameterize the random multinomial with
its minimal exponential family representation (i.e., K-1
parameters).  those parameters are then drawn from a K-1 dimensional
multivariate gaussian.
more specifically,
draw x_{1:(K-1)} from a K-1 dimensional gaussian
set x_K = 0
p(z|x) \propto exp{x}
with this LN, every possible value of x is associated with exactly
one point on the simplex.  the alternative, where X is drawn from a K
dimensional gaussian, has the property that different values of X
lead to the same point on the simplex.
the variational posterior is also a minimal LN.  so, the Kth
component of lambda is fixed at 0.
that said, the program should not be assigning all the words to the
Kth topic.  i know that several others from this list have gotten the
code to work successfully, and i have too.  i'm not sure what that
problem could be.
all the best,
dave
