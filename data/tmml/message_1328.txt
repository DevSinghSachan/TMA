Hi all,
I'm using HDP model and the code 'npbayes-r1'. Can someone help me to
solve a problem on constructing a presentation
of HDP in the code.
As *the*  paper (*Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, *Y.W. Teh, M.I.
Jordan, M.J. Beal and D.M. Blei. JASA 101(476):1566-1581, 2006.) said,
HDP dose not assume a fixed finite number of topics, but why the
number of topics ('numclass') is set manually in code 'testbar.m'? I
have noticed that the number is updated with the iteration, but
different initial values do effect the result of topic number. Can I
use any function in 'npbayes-r1' to generate 'numclass' automatically?
Or how to set the number of topics manually?
Thank you very much!
Best,
christine
