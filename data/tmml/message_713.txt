Hi all,
I'm using Blei's C implementation of the Correlated Topic Model (CTM)
to model some music data in which we use a fixed number of K = 24
topics that correspond to musical keys. Naturally, I'm interested in
analyzing the correlations between these keys (topics). However, I'm
confused as to why the dimension of the learnt covariance matrix from
this code is (K-1) x (K-1) and not K x K.
I've pasted the excerpt from the README
(http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/ctm-c/README) below for easier
reference:
"final-cov.dat, final-inv-cov.dat, final-log-det-inv-cov: These are
files corresponding to the (K-1) x (K-1) covariance matrix between
topics.  Note that this code implements the logistic normal where a
K-2 Gaussian is mapped to the K-1 simplex.  (This is slightly
different from the treatment in the paper, where the K-1 Gaussian is
mapped to the K-1 simplex.)"
Could someone explain why the output covariance matrix is not K x K,
and furthermore, how I can obtain information about correlations for
the Kth topic? Also, what is the significance in using a K-2 Gaussian?
(And how is it possible to do this without losing information?)
Thanks in advance,
Diane
