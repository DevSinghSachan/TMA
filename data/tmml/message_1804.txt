Hi Christopher,
You can find more information about this type of plot in a paper Dave
and I wrote last year:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mimno/papers/mimno-ppcs-emnlp.pdf
Here's the short version. Consider all the instances of some word that
are assigned to a particular topic. The x-axis in that plot measures
how evenly distributed that word is among the documents, relative to
how evenly distributed the topic as a whole is. For example, in a
topic about taxes, the word "tax" occurs in almost all of the articles
that contain that topic, but the word "property" (representing a
subset of taxes, property taxes) occurs in only a subset of those same
documents. The word "property" is thus more specific than "tax".
