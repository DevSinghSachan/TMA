It is possible to do better than random sampling. See Larger Residuals,
Less Work: Active Document Scheduling for Latent Dirichlet Allocation
by Mirwaes Wahabzada, Kristian Kersting, ECML 2011:
"... in each iteration, residual LDA actively selects documents that exert
a disproportionately large influence on the current residual to compute the
next update. On several real-world datasets, including 3M articles from
Wikipedia, we demonstrate that residual LDA can handily analyze massive
document collections and a nd topic models as good or better than those
found with batch VB and randomly scheduled VB, and significantly faster."
