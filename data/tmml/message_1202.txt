Hello all,
I have been playing with Hoffman's online LDA for computing topic distribution of a corpus of size 6544. The main problem is, I am not sure how many passes would be sufficient.
I crated a toy corpus of 30 documents and 4 explicit topics and for that corpus it took 100 passes to converge to the right distribution.
How would this scale to a corpus of 6544 documents and 40K words?
Any ideas?
