Alexandre,
Similar to the paper I cite below, thus far I am seeing a peak at 40 and
am extremely curious as to the cause and conversely, what would make the
number shift.
David Blei and Daiv Mimno pointed me to
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/MimnoBlei2011.pdf
<http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Eblei/papers/MimnoBlei2011.pdf> which
cites posterior predictive checks for evaluating models which sheds some
light on this issue . . . but only indirectly.
I am still searching for additional papers and doing some prototyping to
see if I can get a better handle on it.
