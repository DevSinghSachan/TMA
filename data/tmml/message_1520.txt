Dear all,
I am interested in the data used in Blei & Lafferty's Correlated Topic
Model (2007), which is part of the JSTOR dataset.
After browsing the relevant publications/Jstor I fear, that it is not
publicly available.
Is that true or does somebody have access to it?
Apart from that corpus, are there some "benchmark" datasets, to evaluate
different LDA variants?
Kind regards,
Anja Pilz
