Dear members of this mailing list,
After looking over the archive of this mailing list, I found some
previous questions on calculating the perplexity.  Thanks for Gregor
Heinrich's tutorial, where I found the answers to most the questions.
However, I still get a question left  --- :-)  It seems that the
perplexity relies on \Theta_{test_corpus}, does this mean that we need
to do few iterations of Gibbs sampling with the test data to estimate
\Theta_{test_corpus},  and then can we compute the perplexity?  If so,
how many iterations are required?
Best,
Yi
