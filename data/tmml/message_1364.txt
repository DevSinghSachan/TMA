Hi:
Did anyone try running Hierarchical Dirichlet Process based LDA
(HDP-LDA) on a large collection (> 3K) of small documents (document
word counts < 10-20). Is there any effect of the document size on
learning the number of topics? From a couples of experiments, I
noticed that the document size has a limiting effect on the corpus
wide topics. I was using the HDP-LDA model (Hierarchical Dirichlet
Process, Teh 2006) with the Chinese Restaurant Franchise based Gibbs
sampler (Chong Wang's implementation). Any thoughts on this??
Thanks!
Clint
