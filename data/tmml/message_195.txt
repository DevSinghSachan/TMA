hi all,
I try to implement the nCRP hLDA , but when I evaluate the algorithm
using the bar example I found the tree structure stabilized very quickly(1-2
iterations after the initialization), after that the tree structure doesn't
change very much( once in a while a small branch will be created but trimmed
very quickly) I use the initialization method suggested by David blei,and I
runs the initialization serveral times and pick the initial state with the
highest p(w|z,c). I also notice in the original nCRP paper David mentioned
"To avoid them(Local Maxima), we randomly restart the sampler 25 times and
take the trajectory with the highest average posterior likelihood", does
"restart the sampler" means tring serveral initialization?
Also I'd like to confirm that, after a document had been reassigned to
a different path,is it correct to simply copy all level assignment to the
new path. (by "copy", I mean when sampling the new level assignments,
statistic like n_{-i,c{m,l}}^{d_i},n_{-i,c{m,l}}^{w_i} counts the level
assignment that is previously resided in another path).
Best
