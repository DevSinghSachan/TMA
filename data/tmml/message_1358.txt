Hello All,
I have a problem about the distribution of \theta in LDA model. In Dr
Blei's paper, it says that \theta is a Dirichlet variable. However, in
"Topics over Time: A Non-Markov Continuous-Time Model of Topical Trends",
Xuerui Wang takes it as an the multinomial distribution of topics(table 1.
"?_d: the multinomial distribution of topics speci?c to the document d").
In my understanding, "?" is the distribution of documents over topics,
and it should be multinomial distribution. I wonder why it is sampled from
Dirichlet distribution in LDA model.
Thanks a lot.
