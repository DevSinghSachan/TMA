Hi Tom,
We looked at a similar problem in our KDD paper last year:
Scalable Distributed Inference of Dynamic User Interests for Behavioral
Targeting
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amahmed/papers/UserModeling_KDD11.pdf
In our setup, you can observe a new document or an addition to (some)
existing document(s) at any time point (a document in our setup is a user).
Thanks,
Amr
