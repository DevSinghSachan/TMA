Hi there,
I have tried to test LDA stuff with the given data( ap.dat) using the lda-c
code
(from the website www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/)
After I compiled the code and extracted the data under linux (fedora core),
I used the following command:
./lda est 0.5 100 settings.txt ap.dat random
and
./lda est 0.5 100 settings.txt ap.dat
but the result are both like:
reading data from ap.dat
number of docs    : 2246
number of terms   : 10473
Segmentation fault
The bash always indicated that there is a Segmentation fault !
Has anyone met the same problem?
or has anyone could tell what I should do with it?
thanks in advance
