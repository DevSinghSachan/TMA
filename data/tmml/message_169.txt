Dear Prof. David Blei,
Thanks very much for your reply.
As you mentioned, we don't need to count each occurrence of each term,
so could I conclude that the complexity is O(NKVz) where z is a ratio which
measures the sparsity of occurrence? Vz is generally smaller than the value
of M which is the average document length. Is this why VEM is faster
than GS for high-dimensional problem.
Many thanks.
Best regards,
Yangqiu.
