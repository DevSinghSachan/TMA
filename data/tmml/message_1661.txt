The Dirichlet distribution is typically parameterized with a single
parameter vector \theta, but one can also parameterize it with a normalized
base measure m and a concentration parameter \alpha such that \theta = m *
\alpha.  In that case, one can use a Dirichlet prior over the base measure
m, and a Gamma prior over \alpha, and things work out quite nicely.
A good paper to look at for an example of this is Hannah Wallach, et al.'s
"Rethinking LDA: Why Priors Matter":

I hope that helps.
