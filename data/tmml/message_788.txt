Hi -- hopefully my question is not too much "off-topic": Regarding
datasets for topic models, CiteSeer has been used quite frequently in
the topic models literature, esp. with models that cover linkage and
authoring structure. When using the CiteSeer "raw" data, it's  no
surprise that this corpus is rather noisy: high portion of
near-duplicate documents and duplicate authors, probably due to OCR
errors. (The more recent CiteSeerX OAI dump does not seem to make a real
difference.)
Many experiments just use tiny subsets that were manually cleaned... But
is there a reasonably cleaned version of CiteSeer (or a 20k+ documents
subset) available somewhere ? Or alternatively, is there another
"mid-size" dataset with metadata like citation and co-authoring
structure (arXiv, Cora, Rexa, ACM)?
Thanks for hints + best regards
gregor
