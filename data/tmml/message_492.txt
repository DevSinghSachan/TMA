Hi, I'm MS student at KAIST who are studying LDA.
I have some basic questions about LDA.
Please help me~
1. We inference LDA model to get p(theta, z|w, alpha,beta)=p(theta,
z,w|alpha, beta) / p(w|alpha,beta).
we can get p(w|alpha, beta) by variational inference or EP or others.
But how can I get p(theta, z|alpha,beta)?
2. In final.gamma file, there is a  [# of topic] * [# of docs] matrix.
Is this p(theta, z| w, alpha, beta)?
If then, why gamma is related to p(theta, z| w, alpha, beta)?
3. I think gamma is related to D(theta| gamma) = p(w|alpha,beta)
Because gamma is scalar in this program, we should think
gamma_1=gamma_2=...=gamma_A  (A=# of subtopics)
Then how can I get p(theta, z) from D(theta|gamma)?
Maybe I can get p(theta, z) from D(theta|gamma) by sampling, but I think it
has different value every time.
I'll look forward to the answer mail.
Best regards, SeungRyul.
