Hi All,
I have a text file representing link structure where i^th line represent
document d[i] and entries in it are the docids which have link with d[i]. If
i want to import this file data into R  two dimensional list, any idea how
shall i do it. I want to represent this as link data used in lda package in
R.
Thanks,
Govind
