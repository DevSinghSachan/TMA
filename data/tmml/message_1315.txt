Sample dataset can be found at
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/ap.tgz.
I already did this testing and verified that my implementation gave the same
results as David Blei's except for small precision errors in the 6th decimal
or so.
It definitely helps to have additional testing. If you do intend to test it
yourself, please make sure to either turn off the random initializations, or
have the same random seed in both the implementations to ensure both models
have the same starting points.
