Hi Radim,
You find the macros and examples here:
http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~dietz/probabilistic-models-tikz.zip
Macros are in the preamble of the *.tex (or *.lyx) file. They need the
two *.sty files to compile.
If you want to check first whether you like the output, look here:
http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~dietz/probabilistic-models-tikz.pdf
As mentioned before, I prefer the directed factor graph notation over
the classic plate diagrams. But you can create both with the macros.
I hope the examples get you started! If you have any questions bump me
an email.
Cheers,
Laura
