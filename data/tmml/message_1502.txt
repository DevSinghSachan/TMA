Hi people,
I read about  Fast Collapsed Gibbs Sampling For Latent Dirichlet Allocation by
Ian Porteous. However, one thing that confuses me is that for his equation for
collapsed gibbs sampling -
p(zij = k|z?ij , x, ?, ?) = 1/Z * akj  * bwk
whereby akj is Nkj + alpha , Nkj is number of times word in document k has been
assigned to topic j,
bwk = (Nwk/ Beta)/(Nk + W * Beta), Nwk is the number of times word w has been
assigned to topic k
My question is:
Why does he normalized the akj part of the equation like what he did with bwk? I
was referring this to the collapsed gibbs sampling equation I saw in 'Finding
Scientific Topics' and realize this difference.
