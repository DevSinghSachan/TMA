This is getting off-topic, but since it took me a while to figure this
out, it might help others too:
Actually, under Ubuntu (debian), you need to make sure you
installed libatlas3gf-sse2 instead (or in addition to) libatlas3gf-base
(which is the non-optimised slow x86 code installed by default). Other
distributions might also have this split between generic and
processor-specific versions.
Once these are installed under /usr/lib, numpy picks them up
automatically. This is probably independent of distribution.
