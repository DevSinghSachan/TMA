David Newman and others at UC-Irvine have some very interesting papers about
parallel Gibbs sampling in LDA which you might find helpful. The JMLR paper
would be a good place to start
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1755845
I coded up a Python + NumPy + C implementation of one of their algorithms
for multicore in order to speed up my own experiments.  I got major speedup
vs standard collapsed Gibbs but did not do detailed benchmarks.  If you are
interested it is available at

Hope that helps,
Dave
