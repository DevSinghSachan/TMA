Dear list,
I've made a small update to the ILDA package (v0.93). It completely supersedes
the version posted earlier and is available now on my page:
http://arbylon.net/resources.html
The major change is that I connected the simple corpus generator and visual
matrix display to the IldaGibbs class, so one can visually observe how topics
are created and that they indeed have meaningful content (see Griffiths' and
Steyvers' description of the illustrative synthetic dataset, published in their
2004 PNAS paper, "Learning Scientific Topics").
Moreover, I added the example corpus as a separate package because in addition
to the information I could extract from the data provided by the late Sam Roweis
and the sources on nips.cc, there's some new relational data:  (1) citations
between NIPS papers and  (2) "mentionings", i.e., names of NIPS authors
mentioned in papers, which yields another modality of reference (and influence)
between work. From other sources I've included information on authors, category
labels, volume. It's a cozy little test corpus for "multi-modalilty" topic model
and other text mining applications.
So far, I really had a hard time looking for a corpus with full text and
multiple modalities of meta-data. Maybe I wasn't the only one...
Cheers
gregor
