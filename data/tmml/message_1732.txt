Dear Topic Modelers,
I am trying to implement collapsed Gibbs sampling for the Hierarchical
Pitman-Yor process and wondered if anybody would be willing to share
some insight into sampling the hyperparameters (discount and strength
of the various PY processes). Is there a public implementation of
HPY-LDA that I could learn from?
Cheers,
Josh Shadlen
