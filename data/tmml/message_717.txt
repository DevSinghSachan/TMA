Dear List,
has somebody a detailed description (description of the iteration loop)
of a Gibbs sampler for HDP-LDA. For some reason i miss (or hardly
understand) the K_new step. I do not know how to implement the test/step
for testing if we sample from a new topic (remaining "free" probability
value to assign).
Thank you all
