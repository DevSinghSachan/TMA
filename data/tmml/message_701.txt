Hi all,
I'm new to this mail list, and recently I was wondering if there are any
work related to topic modeling on short text documents, such as queries
or tweets, as I know these kind of short text suffer from sparsity and
heavy noise.
Anyone familiar with this topic please enlighten me.
Many thanks!:)
