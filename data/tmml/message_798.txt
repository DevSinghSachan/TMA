Shivani,
you can use the likelihood (or log likelihood) of a corpus, but you
should use a test corpus, i.e. documents that are not used for training
the model, to measure how well the model works in practice. Otherwise
you may select the model that is best in overfitting to your training data.
Cheers,
Laura
