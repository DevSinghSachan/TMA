Regularization of topic models with graph structure has been looked at
by Mei et al.  (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1367512).  You
might also want to look at Nallapati et al.
(http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1401957) or some of my own
stuff (shameless plug: http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4331) for some
different approaches.
