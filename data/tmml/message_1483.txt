Hi, all:
I am running an experiment of LDA. I am wondering how can we decide the
proper Topic number? what elements will influence the Topic number. I regard
an image as a document, and the sift points as words. The document number is
1000, for every document, there are nearly 2000 points. From your
experience, what the topic number is proper?
Thank you very much, appreciating your answers.
BR,
Scarlett
