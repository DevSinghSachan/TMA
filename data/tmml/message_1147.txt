Someone with information theory inclinations such as myself might say, ?A
model which, given a certain choice of subset from or probability
distribution over a finite, discrete set of things called topics, gives you
back side information which allows significantly better compression of some
subset of some given data than any other choice or no side information at
all.?
With that definition all the things you mentioned would count as topic
models. The ones that give a relevant probability distribution back directly
such as LDA would be easiest to use in the way suggested by the definition.
Related things that aren't usually thought of as topic models, like vector
quantization schemes, would also count.
