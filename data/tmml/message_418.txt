Hello,
I've been trying to get the CTM code working within a Cygwin framework.
Initially, I kept getting an error message saying that -latlas could not be
found (although the Atlas library was installed as part of LAPACK). When I
remove this flag, the code complies and I can run it, although it seems to
get stuck in an infinite loop when I try to find more than 5 topics on my
corpora.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!!
Thanks,
David
