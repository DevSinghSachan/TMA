Dear Topic Modelers list,
I would like to point you to a new publication in the IEEE Signal
Processing Magazine that draws heavily on LDA and the Author-Topic model
for real-world applications.
All best,

Studying Group Behaviors: A tutorial on text and network analysis
methods<http://mit.academia.edu/DavidBroniatowski/Papers/1450052/Studying_Group_Behaviors_A_tutorial_on_text_and_network_analysis_methods>
Abstract
Many important technical and policy decisions are made by small groups,
especially by deliberative committees of technical experts. Such committees
are charged with fairly combining information from multiple perspectives to
reach a decision that one person could not make alone. Committees are
social entities and are therefore affected by any number of mechanisms
recorded in the social sciences. Our challenge is to determine which of
these mechanisms are likely to be encountered in the deliberative process
and to evaluate how they might impact upon decision outcomes. In
particular, we examine the role of committee deliberations on the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration's (FDA's) advisory panels.
