Hi Laura,
first of all, thank you very much for your help.
Actually I was thinking that the CRP prior must by incorporated somehow at
the time where you draw a whole path for a document as a block, according to
the paper. So, having the previous state of the markov chain (or the initial
assignments the first time), and knowing that the maximum number of leaves
is number_of_existing_paths + number_of_existing_internal_nodes, I was
thinking of a way to calculate the prior prob. of a new path but I guess
that I am a little confused at this point.
Thanks again,
cheers.
ilias.
