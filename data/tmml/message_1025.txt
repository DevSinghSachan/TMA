Hi,
I've recently started experimenting with the supervised LDA [1] model and I
have a couple of questions (I am trying to replicate the results in the
paper):
1) For the movie review data set, how was the vocabulary chosen? It says
that there are 5000 terms chosen by tf-idf, but this is a per-document
measure, so I don't understand how a term can have an overall corpus-level
tf-idf weight. I could have a tf-idf "cutoff" for each document but this
will not guarantee exactly 5000 terms.
2) In the same section: "For both sets of response variables, we transformed
to approximate normality by taking logs. This makes the data amenable to the
continuous-response model..." Could someone please clarify this? When using
the sLDA package, how do I transform the outcome classes to the continuous
range described here?

Thanks,
