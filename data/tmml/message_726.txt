hi, all
i just put a C++ version of two-level hierarchal Dirichlet process(hdp) implementation (with split-merge operations) for topic modeling at http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chongw/software/hdp.tar.gz
some features:
1) it has a relatively user-friendly command-line interface.
2) it uses LDA-C data format, so anyone who has used lda-c code should be able to use it immediately.
3) it has many options for the sampling hyper-parameters to play with, but also with default values.
4) it has a new split-merge operation of topics, although it's still preliminary.
5) it has a good output organization, which is easier for post-analysis using R, e.g. monitoring the Markov chain.
btw: it depends The GNU Scientific Library (GSL), which you should have installed from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/.
for more information, please read the README file or simply run it!
i hope it would be helpful if you want to run hdp for a quick analysis. welcome to try it out!
all the best
Chong
