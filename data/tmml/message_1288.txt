Hi Dave --
no problem to put up a zipped version with dependencies included that now are on
SF.net.
Code has been lying around way too long and I didn't want to wait longer, so
it's a single class now ;)
Before I find the time to wrap up the zip: The data reader NumCorpus.java is
compatible with svm-light, which opens up example data used also for other
implementations (like lda-c that uses the same input format). The NIPS0-12
"quasi-standard" corpus is bundled with the knowceans-tools package that I host
on sourceforge and that contains also the data reader. See:
http://knowceans.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/knowceans/knowceans-tools/ .
Best
Best regards
gregor
