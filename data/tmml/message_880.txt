Re: hyperparameter optimization -- I have found this to have varying utility
depending on the application for which you are using the topic model. Same
with the heuristic approaches (and, depending on the publication, I've seen
beta values of 0.1; 0.01; or 200/W).
In practice, I've found that hyperparameter optimization gives me many more
topics than I would have expected (~200 in a corpus with only ~2500 words
and ~1500 documents) but then I did use an improper prior. Furthermore, the
topics that were found tended to have high frequencies of domain-specific
words.
For the AT model, I've found that 200/W and 50/T work quite nicely.
