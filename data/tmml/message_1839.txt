Hi Chaney,
One more question,
How can I filter out non-important words such as 'I', 'the', 'to' etc. when
using lda to estimate the topics? I try to edit the vocabulary.txt file
directly. It works when generating topics, but later when I try to
visualize it using TMVE, seems the model is corrupted. Any ideas here?
