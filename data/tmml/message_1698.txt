Hi,
Parameters estimations for LDA like models take into account words
occurences so the conditional probability Pr(w|z) for rare words is usually
small.
Imagine we know informative rare words. Can we use this knowledge in
parameters estimation in LDA to increase Pr(w|z) for such words?
Can we use for this purpose assymmetric Dirichlet prior for words
distribution?
Thanks in advance, Vasiliy.
