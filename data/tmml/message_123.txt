It is not that hard to pull the relevant code out of the Matlab
toolbox at http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/programs_data/toolbox.htm.
I did it once myself a while ago, although it is quick to implement
the same thing from scratch (100 lines or so, if that).  Just grab the
function GibbsSamplerLDA out of the .cpp file of the same name and
clean it up.
