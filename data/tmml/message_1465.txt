A frequentist approach would be to count the occurrences of each word in the
corpus.  Business will probably occur more frequently than hockey.   These
words are what I call "topic-specific stop words".  They are not
"language-specific stop words" like "a", "an" or "the", but they are
topic-specific.  For example,  some "sports"-related stop words might be
"sports", "games", etc.
So you may want to count the occurrence of each word within a specific
topic, then remove the highest-occurring words.
Another radically different idea is to use WordNet.  Words that have more
senses (e.g., business) in WordNet, need to be weeded out.
