Hi members,
Can anyone please let me know if there is a conjugate prior for a Dirichlet
distribution? I need to generate some observation according to the
following:
1. generate \theta~Pr(\alpha) where Pr is the distribution I am searching
for and \theta is a probability vector and \alpha is some parameter
2. generate y~Dir(\rho*\theta+some other vector coming from a different side
information) where y is my observed probability vector and \rho is some
scaling parameter.
Thanks,
Ayan
