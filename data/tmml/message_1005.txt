Hi Veena,
The count is there because all the occurrences of the same word in a
document get the same value of phi in the variational inference. So it's
just an efficient data organization to compute phi's only for the unique
words and then sum over all its occurrences rather than maintaining a phi
for each occurrence of a word.
Thanks
