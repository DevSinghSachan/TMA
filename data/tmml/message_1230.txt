I'm a student studying the Correlated Topic Model. I've read the original
paper for a few days but it seems too hard for me to understand the
calculations used in the paper. Which algorithms, methods should I study in
order to understand the paper (basically, I have no knowledge about EM
algorithm or variational method). Can anyone shows me the relevant
resources and in what order should I read those papers. Thank in advance!
P.S. I'm not from an English speaking country so sorry if my English is not
good.
