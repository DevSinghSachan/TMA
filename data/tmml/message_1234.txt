Dear Topic Modelers,
I am doing some related works on correlated topic models. Anyone has some idea about how to calculate the perplexity of the?remaining?words after observing a portion of the document, i.e. how to calculate the conditional probability p(w(i) | Phi, w(1:p))?
Thanks a lot!
Regards,Darren
