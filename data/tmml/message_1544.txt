Hi Harry,
I did some work in that direction in my PhD thesis. [1]
The focus of my work was rather on understanding social interactions
with respect to songs/items. However, some of the learned lessons might
be useful for your work.
See Subsection 5.5.2 in [1] on experimental results on data from the
music domain. It talks about the relationship of topics of artists and
studies the relations to genres.
The summary is that topics found in an unsupervised manner correlate
with genres. Sadly, using those topics as a recommendation prediction
did not work super great (once you omit the artists the user already
listened to in the past from the test data set).
I'd love to discuss ideas on how to make this prediction better suited
for song recommendation.
For the numbers and plots see Subsection 5.5.2 in:
