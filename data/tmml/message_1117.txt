Hi Vikas,
Increase the number of lantent topics do not necessary indicates a that
perplexity is decreasing.
Perplexity is an indicator of how good your model infers unseen data. So, if
your results are correctly
obtained, it seems that 20 latent topics provides a better model of your
observed data.
Try also with k=10 and/or k=15. It is also a good practice to average perp
results over several executions of lda inference.
btw, just for curiosity, which kind of images are you using?, are there all
related to the same meaning?
bests,
