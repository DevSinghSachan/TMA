In this video presentation, Dave Blei at 5:36, he talks about how you can
model the connections between topics.
He doesn't really go into detail as to how that it done.  What measure or
method may he be using in order to model the connections or similarity &
groupings between the topics?  If one has thousands of topics, for example,
is it common to cluster them?  I assume then topics may be clustered, and if
so what distance measure is used to determine the similarity between the
topics?
Thanks, Ian
