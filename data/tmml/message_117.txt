hi list,
i'm going through the excellent paper: "A Collapsed Variational
Bayesian Inference Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allcation" by teh,
newman, and welling from NIPS 2006.  (you may remember that i emailed
this paper to the list sometime last year.)
the results are very impressive: this looks to be a great alternative
to mean field variational inference and collapsed gibbs sampling.
i understand the gaussian approximation employed to update the
variational parameters.  but how do you compute the likelihood bound
function in equation 12?  this seems to need an expectation of log
gamma functions under sums of bernoulli RVs.  the simplifications
taken to get equation 15 no longer apply.  do you take taylor
approximations of the gamma function too?
best,
dave
