This email is to announce the launch of topic-modeling-tool.
topic-modeling-tool is a graphical-user-interface to LDA topic
modeling, and is intended/designed for non-expert users wanting to do
their own topic modeling.  topic-modeling-tool works with a single
download and click on a jar file (on Windows, Mac or Linux).
topic-modeling-tool is an interface to the popular and efficient
MALLET implementation of LDA.  While the majority of users on this
list will not have a need for a GUI, please feel free to pass on the
link to colleagues interested in topic modeling but not interested in
dealing with code.
