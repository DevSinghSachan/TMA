advertise a product, create communities and influence them, etc. Besides,
there is an abundant literature regarding the different aspects of social
networks be it their construction or the detection of nodes playing
specific roles.
However, there is currently no clear understanding of the laws governing
these social networks, in particular how they evolve over time. Thus, it
is difficult to draw a clear image linking the existing models of social
networks and the real underlying social mechanisms. As a result, there is a
big gap in concertizing and evaluating most of the research efforts in this
area. Furthermore, due to the growing complexity of digital social networks
and the huge quantity of new data available everyday, it becomes crucial
for the researchers to provide a clear understanding of the dynamics
of these networks. It also becomes important for the community to not only
understand what is happening currently in the network but also to predict
the next evolution and monitor the trends in the network. In order to be
efficient in analyzing these networks, it is important to be able to
predict the dynamics in its different forms: the content evolution (i.e.,
hot topics evolution), network structure (e.g., creation of new relations),
information diffusion, influence evolution, etc.
To address the above mentioned aspects of social network dynamics, we
solicit the following topics (but not limited to):
o   Information diffusion in social networks;
o   Community extraction, analysis, and evolution;
o   Detection of (possibly evolving) roles;
o   Content evolution and tracking in social networks;
o   Social media recommendations;
o   Information quality and evolution in social content;
o   Security and privacy in rapidly evolving social networks;
o   Evaluation techniques and benchmarks;
o   New challenges in mining social networks;
o   Example studies and use cases of dynamics of social networks;
*Paper submission*
Submissions need to be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings
Template <http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates>. Two
types of submissions are welcome: long with a limit of 8 pages or short
