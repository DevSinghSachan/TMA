Dear Members,
as a start for understanding and using hdp models we are currently
implementing the Chinese restaurant franchise sampler proposed in [1]
and [2].
First, a general question: would it be better to use stick breaking
construction for gibbs sampling or is the proposed Chinese restaurant
franchise sampler more useful in terms of ease of implementation?
Is there any software out there that already implements a gibbs sampler
for the CRF (either as proposed above or stick breaking construction)
that you know of (maybe realizations of [1] and [2] by the authors)?
This might help us to align the contents of the papers to an
implementation and would give us some better understanding of the
proposed samplers.
In [2], we need different functions f for table and dish updates. Those
are basically the topic proportions of tables and restaurants. In
formula 56 a function f_k_new is used.
This should be proportional to the count of customers assigned to the
new dish k_new(which would be 1) over the count of all customers
assigned to k_new without the current customer(which would be 0). This
results in a division by zero, on the other hand, if we decided before,
that for this customer a new table is sampled and a new dish is sampled
for this new table, the probability, that the current customer is
assigned the new dish should be equal to one.
In spite of that, we found the proposal to just generate a sample and
work with that(see [1] p. 17 above (32))
What would be the recommended approach to this problem?
