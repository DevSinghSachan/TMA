Sinead Williamson et al had a paper on this at the nips topic models
workshop:
mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/sinead/WilliamsonWangHellerBlei09.pdf
documents select a small subset of "active" topics to draw words from. But
you're right the dirichlet parameter on the per-document topic weights can
be used to get at this sparsity as well.
Anyway I'd also be interested in hearing more about models in this direction
though. Especially sparse hierarchical topic models.
