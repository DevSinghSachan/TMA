Hi Andreas,
Naively you can have a different beta vector for each topics, where you
increase the count for words that you want to force into the topic. You
can treat the entries here just like other assignment count -- therefore
your approach 1) and 2) have the same effects (unless you have different
lists where each represents one pseudo document). However, I remember
that this approach did not quite work as I expected. For an alternative,
I recommend having a look at this paper, which also comes with code.
