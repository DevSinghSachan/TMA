Hi,all
Can anyone please to tell me how can I make the classification after getting
alpha and beta?
I mean I?ve already got V*K topic matrix and K alpha parameters, but not had
a class model.
For example, a document has a proportion of hidden topic like this:  30%
software \ 30% coding language \ 40% algorithm
How can I decide which field (Computer? Medicine? Economics?)  this document
is?
Any help would be most welcome!
Thanks,
JR
