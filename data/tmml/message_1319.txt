Hi,
About temporal modeling or revolution of topics:
Here is our work titled "Probabilistic Latent Sequential Motifs:
Discovering Temporal Activity patterns in Video scenes.
http://bmvc10.dcs.aber.ac.uk/proc/conference/paper117/paper117.pdf
Though this work is primarily motivated by video activity analysis, it
can be applied to other data sets too.
In this paper we have also referred to other temporal models like:
1. Dynamic topic model -

2. Hidden topic Markov models -  http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~amitg/htmm.html
3. Topics over time  http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/papers/tot-kdd06.pdf
4. Markov clustering topic model http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~sgg/papers/HospedalesGongXiang_ICCV09.pdf
