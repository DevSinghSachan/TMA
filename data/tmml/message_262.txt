I haven't implemented the GEM version yet, but with fixed path lenghts, my
experience was that the most important parameter is the smoothing
parameter over the topic-word multinomials (I think it's eta in the
original paper). Values of .01 lead to hundreds of branches, while .1
leads to a more "reasonable" tree (even then, with most words in one or
two branches). Based on those results, I wouldn't be surprised if a value
of 1.0 for every word type (I'm assuming this is what you mean, and not
that the sum of the parameters for every word type is 1.0) would result in
a single path, since the penalty for adding low frequency words to a
dirichlet multinomial with that much prior weight wouldn't overcome the
penalty on adding paths to the graph.
Note that these parameters also have a significant effect on held-out
likelihood (higher values seems to mean better likelihood).
