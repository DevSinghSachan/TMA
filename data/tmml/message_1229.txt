Hi all,
I am a student researching on topic models. Sometimes, I find it difficult to download the datasets used in some researchers' papers. But the datasets are very important to verify codes implemented by ourselves. So can we build a common space for the datasets and associated links for topic modeling?
Moreover, I wonder whether there are some baseline datasets  and available links for original LDA.
Thanks,
Michael Gao
