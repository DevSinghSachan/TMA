Dear friends:
I am reading HDP matlab codes these days.
I have problem understanding the marginal likelihood computation especially
for multinomial data. In directory npbayes-r1\distributions\@Multinomial,
marglikelihood.m
function lik = marglikelihood(qq,ss);
lik = - cat(2,qq.lik);
qq = adddata(qq,ss);
lik = lik + cat(2,qq.lik);
(1)Why we should first subtract likelihood, then add new likelihood?
(2) Anyone can tell me *a clear expression* of the marginal likelihood when
h (parameter) is Dirichlet and f (data distribution ) is multinomial ?
I derived my expression according to equation (30) in HDP paper, but still
not very exactly as
the matlab code for multinomial data case.
(3) In adddata.m under directory npbayes-r1\distributions\@Multinomial,
What glob.Zi and glob.ZZ represent and how their index orginized?
I think the key to these problems is the expression of marginal likelihood
for multinomial case. I will be very appreciated if anyone can give me some
explanation of one of these 3 questions.
Thank you.
