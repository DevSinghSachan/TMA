Hi Noortje,
Last term I worked on an LDA project in python, essentially calling
Dave Newnan's code
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~newman/code/topicmodel/  [text files, C, Gibbs
sampling inference ]
using subprocess.Popen() and some glue code...
You can look at my project repository here:
http://github.com/ivanistheone/arXivLDA         look in preprocessing/
and project/
I also played a bit with D. Andrezeje's code base, which
is very clean (he wrote a python extension module using NumPy sturcts)
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~andrzeje/research/cvb_lda.html  [NumPy
arrays for data, python C extension, CVB0 inference ]
I am going to be working on such a library this summer.
Nothing fancy -- just automating and abstracting away all
the tedious pre-processing tasks.
Msg me in June if you want to see how far I have gotten.
Peace,
Ivan
