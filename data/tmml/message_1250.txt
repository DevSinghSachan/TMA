Has there been any probabilistic topic models built that
take document length into account?
It seems reasonable that two terms that co-appear in
a ten-word document should have a stronger correlation
than another pair in a 500-word document.
If I recall correctly, topic models assume the topics in a
document are independent of the document length.
Thanks,
