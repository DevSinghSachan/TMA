Hi,
I am wondering if the current ICML 2009 paper of Hanna Wallach
(www.cs.mcgill.ca/~icml2009/papers/356.pdf) "Evaluation methods for topic
models" will also influence the discussion about the choice of T ???
If I understand the conclusion of the paper correctly, perplexity (section
5 Document Completion) might be not that accurate ???
best,
markus
