Hi list readers,
Is there any particular reason why in Blei 2003 in eq. 15 on line 2
and 3 of that equation,
\log \theta_i is substituted with \Psi(\gamma_i) - \Psi(\sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_k)
instead of \Psi(\alpha_i) - \Psi(\sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_k) ?
I know these are suff. statistics but shouldn't log \theta involve alphas when
computed with respect to p distribution and gammas only if computed
with respect to
variational q distribution?
Happy easter
