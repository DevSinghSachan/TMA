Hi Vasiliy,
Here is a (very) recent paper on this subject - the "related work"
section and associated references have pointers to some previous work
in this area as well (full disclosure: including my own):
Incorporating Lexical Priors into Topic Models
Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi, Hal Daum? III,Raghavendra Udupa
http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jags/pdfs/SeededLDA.pdf
Another approach uses pre-defined concepts as topics in a similar way:
Text Modeling using Unsupervised Topic Models and Concept Hierarchies
Chaitanya Chemudugunta, Padhraic Smyth, and Mark Steyvers

Best,
Dave
