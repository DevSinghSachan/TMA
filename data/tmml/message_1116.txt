Hi all,
I conducted an experiment on large scale image database using LDA.
I used 160,000 images for training the LDA and 110,000 images (previously unseen) for measuring
the perplexity.
Training of LDA was done using different number of topics. Maximum number of iteration , termination criteria etc were kept same for training using different number of topic.
And Number of topics vs perplexity results are shown below:
Num of topics perplexity
20 74179
40 76521
60 78290
80 81163
100 83685
120 85195
I was expecting perplexity to decrease with increasing number of topics.
whereas , in my experiment perplexity increase with increase in number of topics.
Can anyone please explain this behavior?
Any kind of comments will be immensely helpful.
