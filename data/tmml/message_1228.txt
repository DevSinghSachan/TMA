Hi Alta,
As Dave pointed, the Yahoo! LDA code is publicly available now. A more
recent version describing the work will appear in WSDM 2011 (a pre-print is
here http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amahmed/papers/Latent_WSDMD12.pdf).
You might be interested also in the tutorial that I gave with Alex
yesterday at NIPS where we discusses several techniques for handling
large-scale topic models in batch and online settings. The slides are
available here:
http://blog.smola.org/post/14117021513/slides-for-the-nips-2011-tutorial .
For online settings, in addition to the excellent paper point to by Matt,
we have also looked at this problem (see above tutorial) using sampling
techniques where we can handle both new documents, and continuations
of existing documents (
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amahmed/papers/UserModeling_KDD11.pdf).
Thanks,
Amr
