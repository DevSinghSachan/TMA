Hey everyone,
I too am facing the similar issue of "Segmentation fault" when I use the
following command in the code of hlda-c - "./main gibbs data.txt
settings.txt out.txt" I am using direct file paths as you can see and
hence, I am not able to get the source of error.
Do i need to change something in the settings file? The format of data file
is correct and works with lda-c (simple lda)
Pls help
