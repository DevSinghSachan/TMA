We are searching for new faculty here at the MIT Media Lab. While we are not
a typical computer science department (which is more appropriate for the
topic models mailing list), hopefully there are some non-traditionalists
amongst you looking for a tenure-track position. We like big ideas and the
capacity to realize them.
Feel free to email me if you have questions.
