hi matteo,
regarding your system problems, i can't be of help.  (full
confession: i've never heard of MinGW or MSys!)
i think that estimating the topics from longer (heterogeneous)
documents with or without the short documents is a fine idea.
there are a number of distance functions that you can employ for
comparing two gamma vectors.  personally, i have tried symmetrized KL
between the two Dirichlets as well as the hellinger distance between
the expected values.  i'm sure that there are many others that you
could use.
best,
dave
