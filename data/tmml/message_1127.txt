Dear All,
I would like to explore how and what is being discussed changes over time in
a large corpus.  To be concrete, imagine I have a large corpus for every
year from 1950-2000.  I would like to address the following two questions if
possible
1.  is the 'dimentionality' of the corpus changing over time?  That is,
controlling for corpus size, can I ascertain if there are more topics in,
say 1980 than in 1960?
2. How does the content of the corpus change overtime? (ie, do topics change
over time?)
I read with great interest the Blei and Lafferty Dynamic TOpic models paper,
which addresses question (2) exactly, and I have read the Teh, et al HDP
paper, which seems most useful for estimating the number of topics in a
variety of settings, but am wondering if it would be possible (or advisable)
to combine the two approaches.  For example, in section 6.2 of the Teh et al
paper, they experiment with  3-levels of DP to deal with multiple corpa.  If
i treat each year as a separate corpa, I could use this strategy, but then I
would be loosing the temporal aspect (ie i would break the 'link' across
time of the Betas that the Blei and Lafferty paper address), I think.
A simple approach might be to just perform an HDP for each year, and compare
the posterior mode for number of topics?  But it seems that this would
ignore an awful lot of information (or would it?).  Alternatively, I could
estimate dynamic topics, but this would seem not to get at the
'dimensionality' (ie scope) question.
At any rate, if there is any advice/ pointers (or cautionary warnings!), I
would be most greatful.
Finally, this list rocks!  Thanks to all yous for the contributions and
patience!
With thanks,
Scott Moser
