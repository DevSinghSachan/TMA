Folks,
Thank you all for your awesome and detailed replies!
I'm a developer and my math and statistics background is definitely
subpar for LDA. I just ordered $500 worth of books from Amazon,
though, on everything from linear algebra to statistics, advanced
statistics, Bayesian networks and information retrieval. Hopefully I
will catch up soon.
The application I envision will automatically identify topics in,
say, RSS and let topics that I'm interested in "bubble up" to the
top. I'm looking to do this efficiently for hundreds of thousands of
feeds.
I'm working with the code at http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/
which I'm looking to rewrite in Lisp, as well as optimize and scale.
Thanks, Joel
