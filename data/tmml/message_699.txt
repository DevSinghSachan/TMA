Hi Everyone,
I would like to integrate LDA in my Python project, So I can called the
C/C++ implementation  directly from Python. Does anyone have a wrapper or
'fast'  implementation in Python laying around. This will really speed up my
project. Thanks in advance.
I am also not quite sure how to compile the C implementation of Prof Blei. I
working on windows and have minGW
