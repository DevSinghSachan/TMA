Hi Mohamed,
I'm assuming you're using the "bin/mallet evaluate-topics" command. If
so, the number you get is the marginal log probability of the words in
a document. -63222 is a reasonable number for a longer document. If
you divide the log probability by the number of tokens, for a good
model it should be between -6 and -10.
