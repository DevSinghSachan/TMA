Dear Friends,
Currently, my job is designing a classifier to classify some short
questions.
The classifier can be trained by a collection of avialable questions with
labels.
And a question can be labeled to several related categories.
Thus, the topic models might be useful.
However, as I have known, the LDA model is an unsupervised model.
Is there any alternative way to use topic models to do multi-labeled
classification?
Thanks!
Yours,
Bin
