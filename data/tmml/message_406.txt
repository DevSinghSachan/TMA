Hi, I have two questions about the model of CTM and DTM.
1. In correlated topic models, the topic proportion is sampled from a
logistic normal distribution instead of Dirichlet as in LDA. I didn't quite
understand the intuition behind such a modeling. Why is logistic normal
distribution has such power?
2. In both correlated topic models and dynamic topic models, the natural
parameter of a distribution is considered. Is this because of computational
convenience (for easy approximation) or any other reason?  Or is this a
standard procedure for all exponential family distributions?
Any comment is appreciated!
Thanks!
