Hello,
i tested the paper implementation with those two settings as well.
1. Jenson Shannon delivers more reliable distances
2. The transition from 1. chunk to the second chunk will be very
unsimilar because the topics will averaging until the window size is reached
3. if you raise the window size you will get little changes in distances
Bye
Andreas
