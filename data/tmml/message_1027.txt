Hi all,
I've compiled the beginnings of an annotated bibliography on topic
modeling here:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mimno/topics.html
Jun Zhu and Jordan Boyd-Graber contributed a significant portion of
these records. If you would like to contribute, please take a look at
the source XML file:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mimno/topicbib.xml
Send me an <entry> element by email, and I will update the file,
subject to editorial discretion. Please note whether you are updating
an existing entry. If you would like to add a tag to several entries,
please provide the tag name and a space-separated list of the entry
IDs you'd like to apply it to, ideally in the order they appear.
For those interested, the XSL stylesheet I used is here (patches
welcome): http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mimno/topics.xsl
