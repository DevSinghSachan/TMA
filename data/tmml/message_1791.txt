Dear All,
Can anyone point me to any text dataset which has both document labels
and document tags? A document "label" is equivalent to what has been used
as "supervised information" in supervised topic model (Blei and McAuliffe,
2007) and document tag might be equivalent to what has been used as
"supervised information" in labeled LDA (Ramage et al. *EMNLP 2009*). It
would be better if the "tags" are shared across different "labels".
Thanks,
