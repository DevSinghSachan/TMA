Dear List members,
i started to play around with the Topic Significance Ranking of Loulwah
AlSumaith [1]
Now i just need some understanding of the results and if they fit into
my research requirements.
The ranking strategy in this work strongly weighs topics far away from
uniform and corpus word distribution. If i have a corpus with a huge
amount of information about one topic like in a news corpus after an
event this ranking does not represent the media agenda. I guess it ranks
the unique character of a topic. So the more documents for a specific
event exist the less semantic unique it is because more words are added
to this topic.
What do you think? My first guess is that this ranking isn't really
useful for relevance of news topics since important news bias a corpus.
Thank you
