Dear list experts -- is there literature about the HDP using the YW Teh's
"direct assignment" scheme for more complex models? (I guess the nonparametric
Bayes pachinko model may be a candidate case for a three-level HDP but I wasn't
able to locate any results beyond the publication yet...)
I'd be especially interested in the hyperparameter samplers in such models,
mainly for validation purposes.
Any thoughts / hints?
Best regards
gregor
