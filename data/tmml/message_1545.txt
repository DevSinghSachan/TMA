Hello,
It seems very interesting indeed. I will try implementing this "form" of LDA
with my own dataset and keep you updated with the results.
One remark, though, given the distributions of artists, and predominancy of
genres such as rock, I don't think topic will closely match genres (in their
usual acceptions). Or did you mean creating original genres ?
Also, some users will listen (or download) to only one artists, and, as
such, the distribution of topics over this user won't be very relevant.
