Dear All,
im sorry if my question appears too trivial but i just crave your indulgence.
I?placed an output folder 'lda_out' , and a data.txt file (in the LDA-C format) in?the unzipped lda folder. Then tried to?run the LDA code?on ubuntu linux?but there seems to still be some problem somewhere. I tried four ways but get errors.
Kindly advise me on the right way to type the command for executing lda and hda in the command prompt on the linux platform.
Thanks
