Dear Mehdi,
The information about the data format is available from the readme file.
Here is the excerpt:
"Under LDA, the words of each document are assumed exchangeable.  Thus,
each document is succinctly represented as a sparse vector of word
counts. The data is a file where each line is of the form:
[M] [term_1]:[count] [term_2]:[count] ...  [term_N]:[count]
where [M] is the number of unique terms in the document, and the
[count] associated with each term is how many times that term appeared
in the document.  Note that [term_1] is an integer which indexes the
term; it is not a string."
Best regards,
Kong Aik
