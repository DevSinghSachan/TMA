Thanks Chris. Very clear answer about the observability of the document
length. As I understand, we can condition any of the unobserved variables we
already have on the observed document length. For example, we can even
condition the hyper-parameter Alpha (parameter of the Dirichlet for
document-topic distributions). So now, we can allow longer documents to
mention more topics, while short documents only a few. This can potentially
be useful for processing document collections where the document sizes vary
considerably. Not bad, if I understand correctly.
