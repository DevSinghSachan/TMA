Hi everyone,
In the paper "Dynamic Topic Model"(David Blei and Lafferty, ICML, 2006),
the forward mean calculation equation in section 3.1, as well as the
backward calculation, seem to be different from the corresponding equations
in the reference "A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction
Problems"(Kalman, JBE, 1960).
I am not quite familiar with Kalman Filter, can anyone tell me which
textbook or paper gives the exact form of equation in Blei's paper?
Thanks for any suggestion in advance.
Best
