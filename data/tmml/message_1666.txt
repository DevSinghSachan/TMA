(forwarding to the topic-models list)
Hi Tuanjie,
1. Yes, the "top topics" for a given document are those that have the
highest weights in the appropriate row of gamma
2. If you want to, you can interpret each row of gamma as an
unnormalized probability distribution over the K topics for the
corresponding document?just normalize the row so that it sums to 1.
(There's a more involved answer to this question, which can be found
in the archives of this mailing list.) But if all you want is to rank
the topics for each document then the normalization is irrelevant.
Hope that helps!
Best,
Matt
