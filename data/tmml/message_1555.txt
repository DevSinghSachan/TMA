Hi Jonathan,
Thanks for replying me so quickly. Your responses to my questions helps me to comprehend the Gibbs sampling for unsupervised LDA better. I really appreciate that. And I have an another question:
If y_d is treated as an observed variable, how to obtain the value of y_d? Take the text analysis for example, given a new document for testing, for each document, y_d is an annotation (i.e., category of document) which will be predicted, so how could we obtain the value of y_d before prediction?
Thanks for taking your time to answer my questions. I really appreciate that.
Best regards,
wluo
