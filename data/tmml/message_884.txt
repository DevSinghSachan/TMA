We did some initial experimentation with initializing non-symmetric
hyperparameter priors for each document's topic distribution and on each
topic's word distribution.  These gave us ok results, but we got some
good traction in our experiments from the hard constraints that Labeled
LDA uses.
One relevant state of the art model (as of last summer) is this one:

shared subspace for multi-label classification. In
