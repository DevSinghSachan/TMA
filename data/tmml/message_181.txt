hi marie,
the code should be easy to adjust to provide these values.
you might try a number of heuristics, e.g., matching with KL
divergence, but there's no reason that the topics will "match up"
since you are estimating separate models.  a different approach would
be to fit a model like fei-fei and perona's, where the topics and
classification boundary are estimated simultaneously.
best,
dave
