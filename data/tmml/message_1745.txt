hi, Radim
Thanks for the email. That is a little strange. (it could be a bug.) I
have been trying on
some new york times data and it does seem to produce reasonable
results, like
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chongw/nyt-topics.txt
But if you look at the tail topics, you might see some junk, since
they are either shrinked by the model or not well converged. You can
take a look at the final.topics to see why that topic is actually on
or not.
thanks
best
Chong
