Suppose I have a collapsed Gibbs sampler, and want to estimate marginal
probabilities for each of the latent variables in the model.   I can
think of two ways to do this, the first one legit, the second not so legit:
1) Continue to run the sampler after equilibrium, and collects stats on
each N'th sample to estimate the marginals.
2) Treat the sampling conditional as if it were a marginal.  That is,
after equilibrium, for each variable, decrement the counts for its
current state, compute the conditional distribution for sampling, treat
that as your marginal, put the counts back, and go on to the next variable.
Option 2) is obviously quicker, but is surely wrong technically; the
question is, how inaccurate would it be?
thanks,
Dave
