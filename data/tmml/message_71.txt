Hi Dave, all is well in london, a bit too busy :)  And you?
I see what you mean now.  Hhmm.. would this be different than the
following: update all theta, update one z_i, update all theta, update
another z_i, and repeat?
Ok.  Unless it is a local minima issue, I would think not, since the
VB solution is by definition a local minimum of the VB bound?  Perhaps
there's other better ways to get to better local minima?
