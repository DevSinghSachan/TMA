Perhaps it's a philosophical point, but to what extent are learned
hyperparameters overly dependent on the structure of the model? In such
cases, can we really talk about topics as sharing the colloquial meaning of
the word?
I'd like to hear the thoughts of people on the list about this.
Cheers,
David
