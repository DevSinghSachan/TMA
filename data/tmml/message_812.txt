It's easy to show that LDA topics often do NOT have semantic meaning, and
simply reflect statistical correlations. We've found, for example, that
LDA is an excellent way to find subsets of a corpus that contain
consistent OCR errors or broken PDF ligatures (eg "difficult" comes out
as "di ffi cult").
Recently I found a similar effect using LSI (i.e. SVD) on a large corpus of NY Times
articles.  In particular, the most prominent topic consisted of documents that were
actually in Spanish, even though the corpus was supposedly NY Times.
Has anyone published a comparison of topics found by LSI and LDA?  By LDA
using Gibbs sampling versus variational methods?
