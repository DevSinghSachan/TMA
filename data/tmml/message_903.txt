Strictly speaking, you should divide your data into 3 parts: train,
validate, and test.  Fit the model using the training set; use the
validation set to select the number of topics; use the test set to evaluate
the model performance.  If you use the test set to choose the number of
topics, you will obtain overly-optimistic results if you then also evaluate
on the test set.
