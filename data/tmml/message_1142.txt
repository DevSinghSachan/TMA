Anthony,
Convergence of a gibbs sampler involves luck with the initialization.
Therefore if you run the gibbs sampler with exactly the same data,
hyperparameters and numbers of topics twice, one may be converged after
a few iterations and the other may take much longer.
Since you can not even compare two runs with the same parameters, how
can you compare two runs with different hyperparameters?
You can just hope, that if you can say something about the average
number of iterations till convergence over many runs.
As a rule of thumb: The more degrees of freedom the model has (aka the
larger the hypothesis space) the longer it takes to converge.
However, you can give the approach a time budget (or iteration budget)
in order to see which model does best - at average - under the budget
constraints.
Cheers,
Laura
