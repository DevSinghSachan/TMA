Hi,
I think that there are numerous approaches available depending on what data
you have and what you are trying to achieve, and because of that it can be a
subjective task. However, there's a section in the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation paper (the Experiment section I believe) where the authors
describe a "perplexity" metric. Perplexity is the exponent of entropy so you
can use it for any distribution. In the paper, the authors use the held-out
test data and calculate its perplexity, varying the number of topics. See
the graphs that are produced. I would guess that you should use the number
of topics that give you the minimum perplexity. Again, I'm not sure if this
is the best way, but it's easy to implement at least.
