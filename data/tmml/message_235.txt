Hi, all:
Anybody worked on the Dirichlet process? I read some paper about Dirichlet process.  I am puzzled by the  purpose of Dirichlet process. Can someone provide some more details about the purpose of Dirichlet process? Or what we can do by using Dirichlet process?
Actually, my problem can be described like that there are several corpuses, and each corpus is generated by K topics, I hope the topic number of each corpus isn't fixed. So can I use the Dirichlet process to model the corpuses to find the relation between the topics of different corpus?
Because I am not a native English speaker, I find some difficult to understand the true meaning of those paper, especially more than half of the paper is about the Dirichlet process.
Thank you very much.
Best Wishes
KeMing
