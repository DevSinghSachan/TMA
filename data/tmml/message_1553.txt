Hi wluo,
* In the derivation, y_d is treated as an observed variable and
hence does not need to be updated.
* a and b are treated as fix parameters
and also do not need to be updated in the inference step (they can be
estimated using linear regression in the M-step, this is the implementation
used in the slda.em of the R-package).
* z_d is updated in the Gibbs
sampling step by sampling with probability proportional to
D.24.
Cheers,
Jonathan
