Hi, all.
I have a question about the Kalman Filter parameters in Dynamic Topic Models.
http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1150000/1143859/p113-blei.pdf?key1=1143859&key2=4413616921&coll=DL&dl=ACM&CFID=7731523&CFTOKEN=81408159
Do we need to get the derivative of the variance (Mu and Sigma) of the
Kalman Filter in the EM algorithm? Or they are set at the beginning of the
algorithm?
Any idea about that is welcome. Thanks very much.
Best,
Huan
