Hi,
I'm by no means an expert but hopefully I can put you on the right track...
1. I'm not sure exactly why the parameters appear explicitly in some
graphical models and not others. I've read papers where they're made
explicit and other papers where they're not.
2. This depends on how you want to represent the distribution over topics
for each document. For a Dirichlet distribution, if you parameterize it with
with a vector of values >= 1, it will have a grater density somewhere in the
middle of the simplex, but if you parameterize it with values 0 < x < 1, it
will have most of its density in the corners of the simplex. If the alpha
values are not the same, the density will be highest somewhere between the
the center and the corners. In the case of LDA, the alpha values are the
same, thus giving a uniform distribution of topics in each document and not
favoring any particular topic *a priori*. So, the convention is if alpha1 =
alpha2 = alpha3 = ... = alphak = alpha; so you only need one value.
You can also let the program estimate alphas for you.
3. There are M documents and each document has N words where N is a variable
indicating the number of words for that particular document. So, you're
right, you can write Ni where i is the document number.
Hope this helps,
Adnan
