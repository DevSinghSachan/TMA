Greetings.
Relevant work by Wang, McCallum, and Wei:
"Topical N-Grams: Phrase and Topic Discovery, with an Application to
Information Retrieval"
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1442141
This paper cites other related work and serves as a good starting point for
exploring possible answers to your question.
If there is more recent work of this kind, I will be interested to hear
about it as well.  By looking for work that cites the above paper, I just
spotted this pre-print by Blei and Lafferty, which I will look forward to
reading:
"Visualizing Topics with Multi-Word Expressions"
http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0907/0907.1013v1.pdf
Regards,
