hi topic modeling list
i am preparing a report about the broad impacts of topic modeling.  i
know that many of you have worked on applications of topic modeling in
industry or in applied research (that is, research where you developed
a live system).  if you have a moment, can you write me a quick email
about the project?  (please send me the email privately to
blei at cs.princeton.edu.)
thank you!
best
dave
