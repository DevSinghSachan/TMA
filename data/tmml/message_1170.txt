Hi Dave,
There's probably someone more qualified to answer these questions than
me, but I'll take a stab:
This is an empirical question. If each iteration is cheap compared
with sampling the stuff that's not a hyperparameter, then by all means
do a bunch.
Yup.
There's no theoretical reason to. In practice, it's possible it could
lead to you finding a better mode of the posterior. You could try it
both ways.
Again, I'd say that the answer depends on which is cheaper. If
hyperparameter resampling is cheap, then you should do it more
frequently.
It's not really kosher to adjust the step size unless some pretty
technical conditions are met. If you're not extremely careful you'll
wind up sampling from a distribution other than the one you care
about.
I recommend you update the hyperparameters on a log scale if you're
worried about the value going negative. Also, if you're using slice
sampling this shouldn't be a problem, should it? Any setting of the
hyperparameters that's less than 0 has 0 density which is certain to
be outside of the slice.
Hope that helps,
Matt
