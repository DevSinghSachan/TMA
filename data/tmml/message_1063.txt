dear michael
there has been some additional work on hLDA.  in particular, chong wang has
developed a variational inference algorithm.  see the paper here:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/WangBlei2009d.pdf
it combines ideas from split/merge samplers with variational inference.  (i
think this is a promising direction for variational inference in general.)
regarding choosing the number of topics, hLDA does choose the tree but it is
limited in that each document lives on only one branch of it.  if you are
happy with the LDA assumptions but want a method that selects the number of
topics then i suggest chong wang's excellent implementation of the
hierarchical dirichlet process
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chongw/software/hdp.tar.gz
this implementation takes a document collection in the same format as the
LDA-C package.  (i'm not sure what format mallet uses.)
best
dave
