Hi to everybody, i would ask the meaning of the beta file, in the
readme file in c code  was written that the beta file is a variational
probability of Dirichilet distribution, this mean that is the
posterior probability of a topic??.  In this way i am  waiting  a
value in range 0,1 but may be with the normalization you will lost a
lot of information.. or the values have a different meaning??
Because in my data (general tex document) i have value in range (0.03,
500) very hight range!! I processed 160 document with 4 topic
thanks for the help
Antonio
