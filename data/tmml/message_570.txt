hi topic models list,
many of you have asked me about my and john lafferty's paper on "turbo topics."
this paper is now available on the arxiv at
http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1013
some python code that implements the procedure is on my web-page,
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/topicmodeling.html
(many thanks to david sontag and neha gupta for comments on the code!)
best,
dave
