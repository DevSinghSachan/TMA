Hi Bin,
Thanks for taking an interest in the package.
1.) The sample is
actually multiplied by p(annotations[dd] | z_i, z_{-i}, variance, beta).  The
variables in the code are very poorly named.   I have attached some draft
documentation on the exact sampling equations that I tried to implement.
2.)
The variance should not be fixed; there's variance parameter on both slda.em
and .slda.collapsed.gibbs.sampler.  No learning happens on the variance
parameter yet but it's on the todo list.
Cheers,
Jonathan
