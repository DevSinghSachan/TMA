Dear list members,
I just joined the list and I've a question :
in order to do MODEL ESTIMATION we need to know the words indices from a
certain vocabulary (in order to build our training data).
I couldn't yet find that vocabulary obtained from the pool of articles
extracted from JSTOR Science articles.
Thank you in advance for your feedback,
