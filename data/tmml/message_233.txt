Hi Topic Model List Members,
I want to ask two questions about Dirichlet distribution p(\theta|\alpha):
(1) Does it make sense when any one of \alpha is less than 1,
if so, what is the mode of the Dirichlet distribution at this case?
I tested it experimentally, and found that mode is at the corner of the
simplex
for which the corresponding \alpha is the smallest one amongst all, is that
right?
(2) How to find the maximum a posteriori estimation of \theta given the
computed
variational parameter of \gamma for \theta, it should be at the mode of the
variational distribution q(\theta|\gamma),
but for \gamma less than 1, how to do it? If (1) is correct, than the MAP
estimation of \theta contains 0,
which will ruin the previously computed sufficient statistics of
p(\theta|\alpha), since log(\theta) will be very small.
