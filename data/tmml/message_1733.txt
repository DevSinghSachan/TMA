There is an implementation of a PYP topic model that's part of a
machine translation package (long story...) called cdec. It was
designed for another purpose than topic modeling, so some of the names
in the code are a bit nonstandard ("contexts" instead of "terms",
"rules" instead of "documents"), but it's really just a topic model,
albeit with some extensions for supporting various hierarchical models
of topic-term distributions.
The relevant bits are here:

Note: the implementation is of the HPYP inference procedure is
basically identical to what's described in:
A Note on the Implementation of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes. Phil
Blunsom, Trevor Cohn, Sharon Goldwater and Mark Johnson. ACL-IJCNLP
2009.
There's also a slice sampler implementation (originating with Mark
Johnson) that is used to do inference of the hyperparameter values.
Looking through the code might be helpful to you.
