dear michael
sorry for the delayed reply.
yes.
that's right---these are the parameters to the distribution on topics
at each level of the tree.
that's right.
these refer to the GEM distribution on topic proportions.  see this paper:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiGriffithsJordan2009a.pdf
this is used in the generative process (on page 7:11) in step 2b.  we
review the GEM distribution in section 2.3.
these control whether we sample the hyperparameters described above:
the GEM parameters and the dirichlet hyperparameter for the topics.
with SAMPLE_ETA and SAMPLE_GEM both set to 0, hyperparameter sampling
is turned off.  it makes sense that it was hard to determine this
effect :-)
best
