Dear all,
Machine learning is an emerging and fast changing scientific area that
is crossing many disciplinary boundaries.  What I often find amazing
about the community is how diverse it is, drawing inspiration from so
many sources, and getting applied in, and transforming so many
different fields.
To help me understand the machine learning community better, and to
solicit opinions of members of the community with regards the role and
place of machine learning in relation to other disciplines and in the
university, I have put together a survey, at:
https://opinio.ucl.ac.uk/s?s=13907
I would really appreciate it if you can spend 5-10 minutes completing
it, thank you very much!  If you are busy just think of it as
procrastination :)
This survey is conducted as part of the UCL Post Graduate Certificate
in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education course on curriculum
development PGCLTHE-D
(http://www.ucl.ac.uk/calt/masters/modules/EDUCGC02.html). No
personally identifying information will be collected.
If you are interested in the outcome of the survey I will be happy to
get in touch with you after it has closed (please just drop me an
email separately).
Apologies in advance for cross-posting.
Best regards,
-yw
ps: Rebecca please post on pascal mailing list for me.  Thank you!
