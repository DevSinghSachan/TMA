Hi everyone
I have tried to test LDA stuff with the given sample data, 2246
documents from the Associated Press (it can be found at http://
www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/ )
Eventually I have gotten 20 words from 100 topics, however, it is not
exactly the same as the words given on the web sites
I ran the following command
./lda est 0.5 100 settings.txt ../ap/ap.dat
afterwards, python topics.py final.beta ../ap/vocab.txt  20 > words.txt
Has everyone managed to get the same result set?
I am wondering how I can get the same result set
Please help me out
Thanks
Kwangsu
