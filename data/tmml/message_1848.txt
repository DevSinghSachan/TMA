Just to follow up on Shriti's question:
I too have had difficulty replicating, for example David M. Blei,
Thomas Griffiths, Michael Jordan, Joshua Tenenbaum. Hierarchical topic
models and the nested Chinese restaurant process  (figure 5),  using
the h-lda code kindly provided.  I keep getting a segmentation fault.
Could anyone point me to the corpus and settings used in the hlda
papers (Blei et al 2003 and Blei et al 2007), please?
With thanks,
Scott
