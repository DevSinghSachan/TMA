Dear Laura Dietz,
You got my idea exactly. I've got the problem a) resolved with the help of
Alexandre. As to problem b), I mean using the LDA model to do some
classification(clustering) work. That's why I want to choose the highest
likelihood(with labels in the paper it equals to arg max p(theta |w,alpha,
beta)) of the k topics.
I don't quite understand what you say " as a document may have more
than one dominating topics. Even words may have more than one dominating
topic.". Does the "dominating" mean high probability ? Then we can always
choose the highest probability of the k topics?.
Is anywhere wrong?
Yours
