Hello all,
I have read the Supervised Topic Models published in NIPS07,  and I'm try to implement it for binary classification problem which is using GLM and binominal distribution in this case.  My problem is how to calculate the expected GLM log-normalizer E[A(\eta^T Z)] part,  which in my case is E[1+exp(\eta^T Z)].  In the paper, it is said there will be a longer version including how to deal with this part. Is this paper anywhere available? Or any suggestion about calculating it.  I tried to use the second method mentioned in the paper, but only found out the derivations of \phi and \eta are rather complicated, including multiple elements like exp(\eta^T \phi_mean). I cannot find a closed-form solution. Is there any good numerical optimization approach to deal with it, or other approach to calculate the gradient of the expected GLM log-normalizer? Any suggestion is welcomed.
