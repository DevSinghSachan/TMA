Hi list,
I'm trying to use the hlda-c code on Prof. Blei's page. But there are some
strange experimental results. Is anybody here using the implementation and
facing the similar problems?
1. If using the MH_update method to update the hypermeter eta, no matter
which value was set initially, it would be changed to the same value around
0.5 at the highest-level and around 1.5 at other levels after a few
iterations.
The same thing happened on updating the GEM_MEAN, which was changed to
around 0.27.
2. The leaf-nodes always contain no terms.
thank a lot
