I came across this paper, titled "Rational Research Model for Ranking
Semantic Entities"
http://baggins.nottingham.edu.my/~wangwei/publications/rarerank.pdf
They propose a RareRank (Resource Rank) algorithm wherein LDA scores are
combined with a directed graph. It is used in the http://swse.deri.org/
search engine. According to them "a three-step computation for entity
prioritisation: in the frst step, data crawled from the Web is transformed
to directed labelled graph, and ResourceRank algorithm is applied to
compute ranking scores for resources.
The second step extracts context graphs using the provenance of the
data to compute ContextRank scores. In the fnal step, a resource-context
graph is derived based on some pre-defned rules, and the two algorithms are
integrated to produce ReConRank scores, which reflect importance of
theresource and its context."
