Hi
I was reading the paper "Continuous time dynamic topic models" by Wang
et al and came across a term that doesn't seem to be defined anywhere
the paper.  In Equation 8 at the bottom of page 3, the value of the
mean of the variational backward distribution, \~{m}_{t-1,w} is given
in terms of $f_t$, but I cannot find a definition of $f_t$.  Comparing
with the earlier paper "Dynamic Topic Models", it looks like it might
be $\Delta_{s_t}$ but I'm unsure.  Could someone enlighten me?
Thanks,
Jonathan Halcrow
