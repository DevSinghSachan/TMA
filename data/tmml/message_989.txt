Hi all,
I have been looking at Blei & Lafferty's "Turbo Topics" paper (and
released code - hooray!), but I am a bit stuck on the derivation of the
likelihood ratio Eqn 4.
In the text preceding Eqn 4, it is said that the newly proposed model
(model "uv" as a bigram) has:
-a new bigram parameter \pi_{v|u}^{new}
-a different unigram parameter \pi_v^{new}
-"all other parameters are identical in both models".
But...if we model v with a new unigram parameter \pi_v^{new}, isn't
normalization going to redistribute unigram probability to the other v
\neq v' (thereby changing \pi_{v'})?
However in the eqn (and the code), it looks like \pi_{v'} is *not*
updated (except in the context immediately following u where it is
scaled by an updated \gamma_u^{new} which makes sense).  Am I missing a
cancellation somewhere or something?
Thanks,
Dave
