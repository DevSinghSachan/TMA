Hi Scott,
I ran into this problem a while ago and figured out the right file format.
I'm including a link to my post to this list where I described the format
of the file.  I just generated it from a MALLET state file, so I don't know
how to get it from the lda-c code.  I'm not even familiar with the output
that lda-c gives you, but if you have a theta for each document and a phi
for each topic, for each document you can find the most probable topic for
each word.  The math is easy enough.
