Yves:
"Data Management Projects at Google" (Cafarella et al.) very, very
briefly mentions a few, though my comments were based more on personal
communication and experience.  Some experimental uses of pLSA, LSA,
and LDA included ads and speech recognition, though I don't know
whether the cases I knew of were used in production.  If you relax the
definition of topic models to mean clusters of words, then models like
that were used all over the place in search and ads.  For example, if
you want to match ads to a Webpage, matching clusters of words to the
page is a natural solution that was, at least at some point, used in
production.
Scott:
Another datapoint -- Yahoo considered topic models relevant enough
to industry that they released code for running it at large scale:
"With a standardized Hadoop integration point, one can just download
the Yahoo Latent Dirichlet Allocation code from Github and start
datamining customer support emails."
