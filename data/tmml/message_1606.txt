You might want to look into the literature regarding Species Sampling
Models (SSMs).  The PY and DP are both special cases of SSMs, but there are
other classes of SSMs that use different predictive probability functions
in order to change the behavior of the model with respect to the number of
clusters it produces.  See this work by Jaeyong Lee, et al. for more
details:

Of course, these models are still non-parametric and always give some
probability to the creation of a new cluster/component.
