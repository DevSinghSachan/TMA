Hi List,
Gregor, which method for the hyperparameter estimation do you use in
your code?
I had related issues when using a Dirichlet hyperparameter estimator
based on moment matching (even with fixed-K LDA). As the sampler
progresses, the hyperparameter got sparser and sparser until I hit NaN.
In a non-parametric version this would yield a growing number of topics.
