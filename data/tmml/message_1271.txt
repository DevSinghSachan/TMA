Hi,
I just came across a paper titled "What?s Worthy of Comment? Content and
Comment Volume in Political Blogs" by Tae Yano and Noah Smith that seems
to address document length prediction expressed as comment "volume" for
a blog post. Although I don't think it implements the original poisson
assumption in David Blei's original LDA paper.
