David,
nice work.  I had two questions:
1. how did you train the baseline language model Dirichlet parameter?
2. why didn't you compare to a pseudo-relevance feedback method like
Lavrenko's "relevance models"?  This has the same vocabulary
expansion effect, especially with the behavior of baseline language
model performance you describe.
