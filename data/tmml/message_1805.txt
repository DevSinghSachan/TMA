hi chris
i am plotting the discrepancy measure that we developed in "bayesian
checking of topic models."  (it is a mutual information between the
document index and word index, restricted to words assigned to the
topic.)  the paper is here:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/MimnoBlei2011.pdf
i'll cite it in the next revision of the introductory paper.  thanks
for pointing this out.
best
dave
