Ayan,
Well, "instantly" seems like a pretty tall order. ;)    However, have
you seen Hal Daume's Hierarchical Bayes Compiler?  It takes
Latex-formatted probability distribution specifications as input, and
outputs C code that you can then compile and run:

I haven't had immediate success with it myself, but then I didn't put
much time into it.    I think it's definitely worth a look.
Has anybody else tried it?  It seems like a concept that would just be
incredible if it worked.
