Hello All,
Now I am just running the HLDA( coded by Freddy Chong Tat Chua, and
rewritten with Python) on text file (file size: 60M, number of words: about
6M). It have taken more than 10 days on a cluster node (CPU: 7 cores, Intel
L5320 @ 1.86GHz, Memory: 16G). But I do not know when can I get the results.
Is there any parallel computation technique to speed up the process ?
Thank you
