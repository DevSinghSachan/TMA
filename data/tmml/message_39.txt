Hi Everybody,
I'm thinking of using Gibbs sampling to do inference of the GM-LDA. There
are two different types of observations (image features and words), and both
the two posteriors p(z|R) and p(V|R) are of interest. Then what is the
update equation for the hidden variables? And how to update with two types
of observations?
Thanks!
Sue
