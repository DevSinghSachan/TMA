Dear All,
Sorry for the bother (yet again), but I am writing to inquire about
the feasibility and ease of extending existing HDP implementations to
higher orders of ``hierarchy.''
The way I understand HDP is that the base distribution (itself a DP)
gives discrete priors over topics, which are then 'shared' by
documents.  If I wanted to extend this hierarchy, for example so that
multiple corpa shared a common base distribution, and the prior for
each corpa was then drawn from an across-corpa DP, how easy would it
be to impliment such a model?
To be specific, lets say I have 100 seperate corpa, and I want to
estimate the number and content of topics in each corpa.  Using an HDP
for each corpus seperately would accomplish this, but (following a
useful suggestion  I received on this board), I would like to include
a common prior for all corpa.  Does anyone have any advice regarding
implementations that would be `easy' to modify to add this extra layer
of hierarchy?  Or is anyone aware of existing hierarchical DP
implementations with more than 2 levels of hierarchy?
Again, many thanks!
Scott
