Hmm, I didn't consider this.  OK, then how about the following?
General words should have more WordNet senses (synsets), right?  Then you
can just look up words that have more senses ..
Another idea is to try some ontology, where upper levels will be more
general than lower levels, like for example, an ontology of mammals will
have "hominids" in the upper level and "man" in the lower level.
