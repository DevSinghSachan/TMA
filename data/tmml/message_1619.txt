Dear All:
I am looking for a implementation of Wang, Blei and Heckerman's
`Continuous time dynamic topic models' (P. UAI 2008).  Or barring
that, would it be advisable to try and modify the existing dDTM
(discrete-time dynamic topic model) code posted here:
http://code.google.com/p/princeton-statistical-learning/downloads/detail?name=dtm_release.tgz&can=2&q=
to implement the cDTM model?
As always, many thanks for any tips, pointers, advice.
Best,
Scott Moser
