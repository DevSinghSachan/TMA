Hi Dear all,
I now understand the basic idea of hLDA, but for the initialization of model
inference by Gibbs sampling, I am still not so clear.
David Blei has replied to one mail in this list talking about it:
https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/pipermail/topic-models/2008-July/000294.html
I am wondering whether there are some papers discuss more detailedly  about
this point?
Thanks.
Best regards.
