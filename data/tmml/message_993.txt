Hi Benyah
It would be interesting to compare/integrate results to obtain cleaner data.
Totals so far:
number of internal citations: 1287
documents with internal citations: 815
documents cited internally: 591
I've also added corpus documents citing non-NIPS papers of NIPS authors as
additional data, which is another >20k relations between papers and people. But
it all needs some further checks because of the amount of OCR noise contained in
the raw texts.
