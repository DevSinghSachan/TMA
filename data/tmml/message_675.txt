Hi Andreas,
if you want to estimate the number of topics along with the data, you
may use the non-parametric version of LDA "Hierarchical Dirichlet
processes", which learns "k" (the number of topics) together with the
other parameters.
You can find papers and code on Yee Whye Teh's website
http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~ywteh/research/projects.html
"Nonparametric Bayesian Mixture Models - release 2.1.
Y.W. Teh. 2004. MATLAB and C code. Implements HDPs where you can have
DPs arranged in any tree structure. Only for multinomials, and only on
linux and Mac OS X.

You will find more info on hierarchical Dirichlet processes and
alternative methods for estimating k in the archive of this mailing list.
