hi zhou
i suggest looking at some of the foundational work on variational
inference.  jordan et al.'s "introduction to variational methods for
graphical models" (1999) is great.  the treatment of variational
inference in "pattern recognition and machine learning" (bishop, 2006)
is also excellent.  finally, take a look at matt beal's phd thesis.
