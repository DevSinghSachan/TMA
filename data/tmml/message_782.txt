hi,
I also came across the paper "Automatic Labeling of Multinomial Topic
Models" by Mei et al. in which potential labels are scored again topic
distributions.
The score is partially based on calculating the pointwise mutual information
between a label l and a word w given the context C:
PMI(w,l|C) = lg( p(w,l|C) / [ p(w|C) * p(l|C) ] )
I'm not exactly sure myself of how to calculate p(w,l|C). Any help is very
much appreciated
