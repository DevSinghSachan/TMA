hi topic-models list---
matt hoffman, francis bach, and i have a paper coming out soon about on-line
variational inference for LDA.  in short, we use stochastic optimization on
the variational objective function.
there has been some recent discussion on this list about inference
algorithms that can be used on streaming data.  with this discussion in
mind, we decided to post the code before the paper.  it can be found here:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/downloads/onlineldavb.tar
it is in python.  it requires that NumPy and SciPy are installed.
as an illustration, matt has included a script that repeatedly downloads
random wikipedia articles and updates an LDA posterior.  (in our forthcoming
paper, we have fit such a model to 3.3M articles from wikipedia.)
enjoy!
best
dave
