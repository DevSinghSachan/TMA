Hi Everyone,
I'm investigating use LDA for collaborative filtering tasks. In Blei's
original paper, the authors map vocabulary to movie, document to user.
However, as we know a document consists of a bag of words, multiple
occurrences of the same words is possible. So my question is how many
occurrences do you use for each movie?
For example, a user rate movie A 3-star, movie B 2-star, what's the user's
corresponding document? Is it "A B" or "A A A B B"?
