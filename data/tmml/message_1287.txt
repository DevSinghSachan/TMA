Dear list --
as a complement to existing HDP implementations, I've implemented Yeh Whye Teh's
direct assignment scheme in a simple Java class
(http://www.arbylon.net/projects/IldaGibbs.java).
It was intended to (1) address the "lower" end of complexity (code is << 1000
lines) and to (2) retain as much as possible of the finite LDA model. This is
why it's called "Infinite LDA".
Some explanations and introduction are found in a note on
http://www.arbylon.net/publications/ilda.pdf.
I post it because it may be useful to streamline understanding of the DP and HDP.
Comments welcome...
Best regards
gregor
