Hello
Does anyone know of implementations of LDA that can take in streaming data
(i.e. an 'online' version of LDA, which doesn't get to see all the data at
once), AND can be parallelized over multiple machines to speed up the
running time?
the web, I have come across code that does each of these two things
separately, but unless I am missing something, I haven't yet come across
implementations that allow for both.
Thanks,
Suhas
