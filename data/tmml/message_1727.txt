Topic modelers,
I have seen a few papers talking about using LDA on short documents
(e.g., twitter messages). There are a few approaches. Some change the
weight of each word in the document based on its specificity; others
gather all the tweets from a given user into a single document; still
others run vanilla LDA with no modifications. And I'm sure there's
some I've missed.
Two questions.
1. What are your general thoughts and feelings about which approach is best?
2. Are there any tools that implement any of the approaches? (Besides,
of course, the vanilla LDA approach.)
Thanks,
Steve
