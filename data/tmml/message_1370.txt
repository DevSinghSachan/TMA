Eric, Thanks for the reply.
Are the following two publications the ones you were referrring to
Latent Dirichlet Co-Clustering (M. Mahdi Sha?ei and Evangelos E. Milios)
Structured Topic Models for Language (Hanna M. Wallach)
Moreover, in the Blei's 2003 paper (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), they used
the posterior Dirichlet parameters (\gamma^*(w)) as the feature. This \gamma
is variational parameter. I am very interesting to know their choice of
\gamma rather than \theta. It seems to me that the estimated \theta(the
probability proportions) have a more clear physical meanings.
Thanks,
Huaiyang
