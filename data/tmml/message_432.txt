Hi all,
In LDA-C, there is a function log_sum, given log(a) and log(b), it returns
log(a+b),
and when it comes to finding the log of the sum of some numbers, the logic
is like this:
log_sum_a=log(a(0));
for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
log_sum_a=log_sum(log_sum_a,log(a(i)));
return log_sum_a;
but I wonder why it?s not like this, in a more straightforeward way:
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){sum_a+=a(i);}
return log(sum_a);
Is there any numerical issue?
