Dear Hal and list members,
Would you explain the last point on computing empirical likelihood;
" use these 10000* drawn words as a 10000-component multinomial
mixture model and compute the likelihood of the test data under this mixture".
I have looked at several papers that use this method and I am still not sure
how it is implemented.
Thanks you,
Said
