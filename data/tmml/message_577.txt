Dear all,
I am a PhD student at computer engineering dept. Sharif University of
Technology, Iran. My research interest is language modeling. I am
currently working on PLSA and LDA to combine them with n-gram for
language modeling.
I read the LDA paper (Blei et al., 2003) several times but I did not
undrestand some parts of it. I have some questions about LDA. Do anyone
knowes:
- If W=w1w2...wn is a sequence of words (e.g. a document) how P(W) is
computed in LDA model (for a training document or a new document)?
- What is the interpretation of variational parameters gamma and phi?
- In LDA model, what parameters plays the role of P(z|d) (that is used in
PLSA model)?
- What does this sentence mean? "LDA extend PLSA model by introducing a
Dirichlet prior on teta"
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
M. Bahrani
