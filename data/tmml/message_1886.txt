Hi Mike,
(CC'ing topic-models mailing list)
You have a few options. Probably the simplest option would be to set
the vocabulary size W to something larger than the number of words
you've seen so far, and then assign new words to previously unused
indices. You could also take a more principled Bayesian nonparametric
approach to the growing vocabulary problem, but that would be
significantly more work.
Best,
Matt
