I should add that as I understand it, compute_ngrams.py should not be used
to create the vocab file.  That script is meant to just find ngrams in a
corpus using their permutation method independent of a topic model (I
haven't ever actually used it, that's just what I understood from their
paper and from looking at the code).  The vocab needs to be unigrams as you
would have passed a vocab file to lda-c in order to infer the topic model.
