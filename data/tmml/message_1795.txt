Hi all,
as I am playing around with David Blei's hlda implementation I wrote a
script that converts the .txt files in a directory into the format
needed by hlda (and ldac). It also provides some options like stopword
removal. Maybe some of you find it useful. You can find a small
description and the code download at my github account:

Best regards,
Johannes
