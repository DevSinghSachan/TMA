Hello everybody,
I am currently working on topic models and just tried to estimate a model
using the CTM implementation and our own data. Unfortunately the cg
computation doesn't converge and I encounter an infinite loop. More
precisely, the problem is that the function opt_lambda in inference.c never
leaves the do-while loop and the converged variable stays 0.00. At first, I
assumed that the problem was connected to our data file and additionally
tried to use the provided sample data file from the LDA implementation, but
with no success. I am using the default settings.txt file and the seed
parameter for initializing EM. Of course, setting the cg max iter entry to
some other value would do, but I still wonder why it won't converge with the
default settings.
Is anybody experiencing similar problems and can perhaps come up with a
solution for this problem?
Thanks in advance,
Thomas
