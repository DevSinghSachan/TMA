You get K as a byproduct. Ultimately, you are just interested in finding
a bunch of useful topics, where you do not really care if you get 20
topics or 21.
Nevertheless, you should be aware that although you do not fix k, you
have to tell HDP how coarse the topics are you want to get. So there
still is some sort of hyperparameter....
Dave, thanks for the clarification!
