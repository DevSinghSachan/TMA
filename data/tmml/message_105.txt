Hi all,
the netflix competition uses RMSE instead of predictive perplexity for
model comparison purposes.
Then, there is netflix with its $1M competition using RMSE. Is that the
right
metric to focus on for them?
I guess chosing the right metric depends what one wants to use the model
for.
What metric would you recommend for evaluating which model to use
for movie-rating comparison?
What are you ideas on this?
Ciao,
