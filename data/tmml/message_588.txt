Hi, all,
I have a question about smoothed LDA which puts a prior on the $\beta$.
The LDA paper says the update rules Eq.(6) and (7) will be the same for
the smoothed LDA and unsmoothed LDA. But I also think that the variational
parameters for the $\beta$ will contribute to the Eq. (6) since there is a
coupling between the variational parameters of the latent variables $z$
and the variational parameters of the $\beta$ in the lower bound the
log-likelihood.
Anyone has the same thoughts as me?
Thanks,
Zhen
