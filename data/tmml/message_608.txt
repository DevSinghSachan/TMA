LDA and similar models have been mostly studied and applied to modeling
topics. With more texts that are rich-in subjectivity available on the
Internet, we are facing new challenges to opinion/sentiment or
subjectivity analysis, which may find their applications in product
recommendation, reputation track and analysis, automatic e-rule making,
etc. So, in this regard, LDA and the like may be used to model topic and
sentiment simultaneously. A possible hidden variable to be modeled
governs a series of strong association between topics and sentiments.
These bindings of topics and sentiments may reveal purchase preference
of buyers (e.g. prefer new features to new look or on the contrary when
people buy new mobile phones); or they reveal underlying ideology that
governs people's political orientation (e.g. prefer free market or
prefer more government control).
Existing LDA-based topic models see no difference among words in terms
of semantics. So, several basic and preliminary tasks need to be solved,
including topic detection, sentiment extraction and association of
topics and sentiments, among other things. But some simplified treatment
may be made for these tasks to facilitate the application of graphical
models to topic-sentiment analysis.
Want to know if there is previous or ongoing work of applying LDA or
similar models (generative or discriminative) to applications such as
business intelligence, review analysis, political orientation
categorization and customer behavior categorization, to name a few.
For those who might be interest in this topic, there is now a relevant
event to submit interesting work or results in this regard. TSA'09 is a
CIKM workshop on topic-sentiment analysis. CFP is now available on its
website here:
