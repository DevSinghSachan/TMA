Dear all,
I am a green hand of graphical model. And I want to ask some simple questions. Recently, I try to apply LDA to image classification and segmentation. I have 4 classes of objects (i.e., 'sky','sea','grassland',and 'sandy beach') in 100 images.  Each image may have more than one class of object. I use 80 images to learn the superparameters of LDA, and use 20 images to test. Now, I have several problems as follows:
1. Should I construct the codebook and visual words with category label for these object?  How to construct the codebook?
2. How to segment the objects from the images?
I have read of [1] which aim to segment without supervision. In [1], the number of classes of the objects is unknown, the codebook and visual words are constructed without category label. Therefore, I think it is different from my case.
Can somebody solve my problems, and provide some related papers and codes to make me learn the theory systematically. Thank you for you kindly help.
