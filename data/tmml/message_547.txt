Dear Kevin,

Variables that are integrated out can in principle be viewed as
collapsed nodes in the corresponding graphical model; in the LDA case
leading to Dirichlet-compound multinomial nodes: p(z|a) = integral
Mult(z|p) . Dir(p|a) dp = DCM(z|a). However, to me this  collapsed
representation seems of limited use as the plate structure in the
Bayesian network (document-wise and topic-wise parameter sets) is not
easily retained.
w_i indep z_i | theta because of the assumption z_i indep z_-i | theta,
or in other words: If you know theta, additionally knowing all z_-i
doesn't add to your information on z_i. However, this assumption only
approximates reality because of the weak negative correlation of
Dirichlet parameter dimensions (vector confined to K-simplex). But this
correlation can be neglected for when token counts >> 0 as in virtually
all practical applications. I should have mentioned this in the paper;
it will be in the next version.
It's generally easiest (regardless of inference methodology) to
integrate out parameters "between" conjugate-exponential distribution
pairs because this is possible in closed form.
