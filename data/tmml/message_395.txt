hi mateusz,
in the E-step, optimize variational parameters for each document and
compute expected sufficient statistics under the resulting variational
distributions.  this step depends on a setting of the model
parameters, i.e.,  the dirichlet hyperparameters and topic
distributions.  in the M-step, optimize those model parameters
according to those expected sufficient statistics.  repeat until the
bound on the log likelihood of the data converges.
best,
dave
