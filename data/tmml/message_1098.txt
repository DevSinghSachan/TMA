Agreed. I simply recognize that hahah and haha are essentially the same, but
do not necessarily separate from jaja. My tokenizer is a set of modules in a
pipeline, and for different purposes I mix & match modules.
Dan--what were you doing for celeb names? Just taking the bigrams and adding
an underscore or the like? I would imagine that all the variations would be
frequent enough not to need any kind of normalization, but perhaps I'm
wrong. You also get socio-semantic-linguistic differences with the
variations--gaga without the lady or using hussein in between barack & obama
has such connotations.
