Hi Bailu,
Thanks for your questions.
1) The IBP assigns positive mass to a row with no non-zero elements.
We wanted to avoid the situation where a document was generated from
no topics. We also thought it was reasonable to assume that a longer
document would tend to feature more topics than a shorter one. So, we
noted that the following generative schemes are equivalent:
for i=1:K
sample y_i ~ Gamma(a_i,1)
sample n_i ~ Poisson(y_i)
end
and:
sample Y ~ Gamma(\sum_i a_i, 1)
sample N ~ Poisson (Y)
sample \theta ~ Dirichlet(a_1,...,a_K)
for j=1:N
sample c_j ~ Discrete(\theta)
end
for i=1:K
Let n_i = \sum_j I(c_j = i)
end
where n_i is the number of words in topic i.
The negative binomial distribution is (with slight reparametriseation)
given by \int Poisson(n|y)Gamma(y|a,1)dy.
I hope this explains our design decision. The paper "Decoupling
sparsity and smoothness in the discrete hierarchical Dirichlet paper"
by Chong Wang and David Blei offers another way to deal with all-zero
rows.
2. I've included this as an attachment. The notation is a little
different from that in the paper, but hopefully not too different.
3. X is not a problem, as we are not using any approximations. For Y,
consider Y* and Y+ separately (as defined in the paper). For Y*, the
the b_{mk} are not iid, but conditioned on the observed pi they are
independent, with finite moments. So Liapunov's theorem holds. For Y+,
we have the limit as K -> infinity of a sequence of random variables
drawn as follows:
\pi_k ~ Beta(a/K,1)
b_{mk} ~ Bernoulli(\pi_k)
- i.e. the b_mk, for a single m, are iid. We know the gamma random
variables are iid. So the CLT holds.
Hope that helps,
Sinead
