Dear ALL:
I'm trying to calculate a measure on LDA and used the LDA implementation of MALLET package. I noticed that the training results are different in different runs even when the random seeds are fixed. Is this because the random values in MCMC code? I also compared the matlab code at http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/programs_data/toolbox.htm, the results could be the same when random seeds are fixed. Any one have met with similar problem. Is it possible that I missused the MALLET package?
Best
