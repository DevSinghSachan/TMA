It is my understanding of the dirichlet compound multinomial (DCM) is that
sampling is allowed to go to infinity of for each number of samples. So, if
you were sampling from a polya urn, you would sample: drawing once and
replacing after infinitely many times, drawing twice and replacing after
each infinitely many times, drawing three times and replacing after each and
so on.
Ultimately there is a unique distribution for each number of samplings with
a larger propensity near the alpha proportions, depending on the confidence
or size of the alphas, and the only time that a larger number of samples
would cause a lower score, is if the samples were not represented in the
proportions of alpha or the alphas were small to begin with.
Of course with the DCM all topics would be integrated out.
