dear shivani
when implementing variational inference or variational EM, i typically
use percentage change in the variational bound as the convergence
criterion.  for example, in our work on supervised topic modeling, jon
mcauliffe and i ran EM until the relative change in the likelihood
bound was less than 0.01%.  see the paper here:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiMcAuliffe2007.pdf
looking at changes in the variational parameters is also a good idea,
though one i haven't explored.
