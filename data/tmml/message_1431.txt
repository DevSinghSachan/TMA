Sorry for the premature posting, I tried to cancel the post after I sent it.? I figured out the bugs that I mentioned in the posting.? I am fixing them and also including a little demo based on the 20 newsgroups dataset that will demonstrate held-out likelihood performance and the document-topic and topic-word mixtures against LDA.? I will repost the package in a day or two and send an email around.? Sorry again for the confusion!!!
