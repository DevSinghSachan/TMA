hi david,
we do not yet have available an implementation of variational
inference for dynamic topic models.
the non-conjugacy between the chain of topics (logistic normal) and
words (multinomial) precludes gibbs sampling.  the conditional
distribution of topics given words is not computable in closed form.
however, other forms of MCMC might be possible.
best,
dave
