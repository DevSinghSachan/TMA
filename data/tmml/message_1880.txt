Dear topic-modelers:
Are there any special considerations above and beyond the 'usual'
advice given for 'flat' LDA models when it comes to selecting the
number of topics as well as prior specification in the (discrete)
dynamic topic model?  I understand from the helpful comments and
references posted on this list that priors can matter a lot for LDA
models, but is there any concrete advice for selecting priors for the
dynamic topic model?
In addition, is it advisable to use held-out perplexity (as in flat
LDA models) as a basis for selecting the number of topics to use?
Any pointers would be appreciated.
With thanks,
Scott
