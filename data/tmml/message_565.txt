Hi all,
In the paper "Finding scientific topics" written by Thomas L.
Griffiths & Mark Steyvers,P(W|T) is proposed to decide the number of topics,
but this method is not introduced explicitly, So I wonder hwo to calculate
P(W|T) in GibbsLda++ with parameter theta and phi,Could you please introduce
the explicit process? Thanks a lot !
