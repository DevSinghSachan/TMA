I am wondering if somebody can recommend a good basic intro to LDA that
is not too heavy on notation from the beginning. Specifically am
looking for a prose explanation of:
1. \theta | \alpha ~ Dirichlet(\alpha, ..., \alpha)
2. for each word n = {1, ..., N}:
a. Z_n | \theta ~ Mult(\theta)
b. W_n | z_n, \beta ~ Mult(\beta_{z_n})
Best regards
