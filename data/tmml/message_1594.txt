Hi,
I am writing about the paper "Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels" by
Airoldi et al (JMLR 2008).
This paper starts out by explaining that when dealing with relational data,
the independence or exchangeability assumption that is invoked in LDA is no
longer valid. Relational data problems can be thought of in terms of a
graph, in which vertices represent the set of entities (people, or
proteins, etc.) and the presence or absence of edges correspond to
interactions (or lack thereof) between those entities. The 'data' is
therefore a set of edges.
(1) I'm not sure if my understanding for why the independence assumption is
invalid is correct, and I'm looking for an intuitive explanation.
(2) It appears to me that the independence assumption is invalid only
because the relational graph we are dealing with, can be an arbitrary graph
