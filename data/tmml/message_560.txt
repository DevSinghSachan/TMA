I have to confess to a rather embarrassing confusion about the
distinction between concentrations and base measures.  I understand
that for a 3-dimensional Dirichlet, alphas of (9,9,9) give rise to a
peak in the middle of a simplex, while alphas of (0.9,0.9,0.9) cause
the probability mass to withdraw to the corners of the simplex.  I
presume that in these cases, the base measure is (1,1,1) and the
concentrations are 9 and 0.9, respectively.  But couldn't the 0.9 case
be viewed as (9,9,9) with a concentration of 0.1?
Suppose further that you had non-uniform alphas and suppose further
that some of them were below 1 and others above 1 - say (0.2,5,7).
What is the base measure and what is the concentration in such a case?
Is it (2,50,70) with a concentration of 0.1?   Are the components of
the base measure required to be integers?  Sorry if this is a dumb
question.
