Thanks Gregor, Laura and Arnim. Thats was very useful.
We already have a LDA based topic model that classifies documents. I was
pondering how to relate this model to Topic Maps and Ontologies. Now I can
see how it might fail for hierarchies and direction. I will take a look at
the correlation models and other references you mentioned.
Thanks
