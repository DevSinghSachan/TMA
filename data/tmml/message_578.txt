Hi all,
I am a PhD Student from Milano-Bicocca university - Computer Science department.
I am currently working on Topic Extraction models and i sometimes i have difficulties to recover the data used in the experiments.
So, i have published a web page containing references to the corpora used in some of the topic extraction literature.
The list is not complete nor perfect but i think can be useful to replicates experiments and developing some ideas.
I will be very grateful, if someone wants to send me additional information and data to extends the list.
I can also offer some storage space to store public dataset like the ones downloaded from citeseer or US senate Thomas DB.
I hope that the list can help me to create a useful resource to everyone :)
The page is here:

Please feel free to contact me!
Thank you in advance!
