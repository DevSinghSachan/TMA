Hello everyone,
I have a rather silly question, but it bothers me, so I decided to ask..
I am using David Blei's implementation of LDA which outputs a "betha file" (the topic/word probabilities file).
For some reason all values in it are negative.
My conception of probabilities is that they are always positive and that's why I don't understand why is that so.
I know my results are correct since I ran the example David posted on his site and it turned out right.
Any insights?
Thank you,
Efrat Safanov.
