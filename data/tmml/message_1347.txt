hello gregor:
Thanks a million for your quick response. I have try to add "epsilon
= 1.e-12" to every element in the two 1*N matrix and then try to calculate
the KL divergence and the answer is not NAN now. Is this right? There is a
question if I do that the sum of the N elements will be bigger than 1,
instead of equaling 1. Will this influence the correction of the outcome?
Thank you very much!
BR,
