Does anyone have a good definition of "topic model", as opposed to just "topic"?
One possible definition is: "a model of the generative process by
which documents are created." This sounds nice, and is very LDA-ish.
But another possibility: "any technique that decomposes a
term-document matrix into a document-topic matrix and a topic-term
matrix." This describes more of the input/output behavior of LDA, as
opposed to how LDA does it.
I have never seen a clear definition, which has lead to some bar-room
discussions in my group. For example, would LSI be considered a topic
model? How about the Vector Space model? PLSI? Could we stretch the
definition of topic models to even include Independent Component
Analysis (if, say, the second definition above were used)?
