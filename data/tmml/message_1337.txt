Hi Everybody,
I have a model which is similar to standard LDA, except that the
observations are not words. The observations are triples. In other words, I
substitute each word with a triple, and I generate each member of a triple
independently. Assume one triple is represented by (w', w'', w'''), and the
vocabulary sizes for each member of it are |V1|, |V2|, and |V3|. If |V1| <<
|V2| and |V1| << |V3|, when I sample z using collapsed gibbs sampling, will
the conditional probability of p(current z | others) be dominated by any of
these p(w'|z), p(w'',z), and p(w'''|z)? If it is biased, what should I do to
circumvent this?
Thanks a lot!
