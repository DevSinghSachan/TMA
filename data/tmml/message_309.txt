dear marie,
this seems like a very reasonable approach.
there are others:
1. fit a classifier using the latent topic proportions as features
(e.g., to an SVM).  admittedly, this is pretty ad-hoc.
2. take the approach of fei-fei and perona (2005).
3. adapt supervised topic modeling to classification.  (see the paper
by jon mcauliffe and me from last years NIPS.)
good luck!
best,
dave
