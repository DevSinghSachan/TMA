hi all
indeed, it was the "go to" distribution for counts and didn't matter
for the algorithm that we developed in the paper.
that said, it seems that document length---and what it means for the
distribution of words within a document---could make a difference in
estimating the topics.  see, for example, doyle and elkan's excellent
paper "accounting for word burstiness in topic models."
