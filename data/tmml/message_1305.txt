Hi guys,
I read about this paper "Online LDA for adaptive streaming"  http://tinyurl.com/4623t9v and its follow-up http://tinyurl.com/64qfr6w in which the authors use actual word-topic counts from previous streams as asymmetric beta prior for the current text streams. New words in the current stream is set to b=0.01
In this way, they are able to track topics and see topic drift (keyword changes) across text streams.
My question is, won't using exact word-topic counts as prior favor very heavily towards seen words and make new words less likely?
My requirements is to see compare and detect topics generated for new documents across each month and not sure if this approach is suitable.
