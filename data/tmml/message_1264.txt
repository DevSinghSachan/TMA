Specifically, the stuff about Chib-style estimation is conceptually
closest to what I was talking about, but better, and what I was
actually doing was closer to algorithm 3, but somewhere between those
two.
The likelihood I was roughly talking about is on line 8 of algorithm
3, and your answer is on line 14.
