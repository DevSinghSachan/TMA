Jonathan,
I noticed that in your document you give the complete conditional for
sampling the topic assignments in sLDA, but I don't see anything about how
you update the eta and sigma-squared parameters.
Do you propose distributions for and sample those parameters as well, or do
you compute point estimates for them?
