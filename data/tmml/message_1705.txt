IEEE PerCom 2013
11th IEEE Int. Conf. on Pervasive Computing and Communications
March 18-22, 2013 - San Diego, CA, USA
*******************************************************************************
CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
****************************************
IEEE PerCom, now in its 11th edition, is the premier conference for presenting
scholarly research in pervasive computing and communications. Advances in this
field are leading to innovative platforms, protocols, systems and applications
for always-on, always-connected services.
The PerCom 2013 Organizing Committee invites proposals for one-day or half-day
workshops affiliated with the conference. The workshops will be held prior to,
or immediately after, the main conference. The purpose of these workshops is to
provide a venue for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and typically more
focused area than at the conference itself.
Please visit http://www.percom.org to learn about earlier PerCom workshops.
Note that PerCom workshops are expected to enable stimulating discussions of
state-of-the-art, emerging, visionary,  and perhaps controversial topics.
Workshops should be organized to promote such lively interaction. Plans to
promote interaction and discussion should be clearly addressed in workshop
proposals.
Workshop proposals are solicited in all areas and topics pertaining to
pervasive computing and communications research and applications. Workshops
addressing new emerging research directions in pervasive computing and
communication are especially welcome.
