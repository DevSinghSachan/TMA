Hi All,
Thanks for your valuable suggestions.
To be specific I have used formula for perplexity as given on page 1008 of David Blei's LDA paper.
Moreover, this paper http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1282283 also uses same formula for computing perplexity and shows
decrease in perplexity with increase in number of topics.
thanks,
vikas
