Hi Yiliang,
It's hard to tell from the error what the ultimate cause is, but it
looks like the beta hyperparameter has been set to not-a-number, which
makes the log likelihood calculation fail with the "NaN after..."
error.
As an immediate fix, you can turn off hyperparameter optimization,
either with --optimize-interval 0 on the command line or by setting
the variable optimizeInterval = 0 in the ParallelTopicModel class if
you are using the java api.
As for why the parameter is becoming unstable, it's hard to say
without looking at the data. I don't have good intuitions for bags of
image features.
