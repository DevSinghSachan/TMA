There is no detailed user guide, but I'm happy to answer any questions.
For long titles or documents without titles, you may want to consider
editing relations.py: make the get_safe_title function in the Document
class return the document id instead of a modification of the title.
For the wiki demo, none of the wiki titles are very long, so this
wasn't an issue.  The content of the articles was fed in through the
get_doc_display function in the template python file
(BasicBrowser.py).  If your documents don't have titles, you shouldn't
make the title the entire contents of the document; make up some kind
of abbreviation instead: an id number, first 100 characters, etc..
Does that answer your questions?
