Dear Topic Modelers,
I'm trying to run the R lasso code included in the Correlated Topic Model
package. When I try to run build the graph, I get the following error:
".Error in l1ce(y ~ X, data = data, sweep.out = ~1, bound = lambda) :
you cannot sweep out all the variables"
Does anyone know why this error is occurring and what it means or how I
could resolve it?
Thanks very much,
