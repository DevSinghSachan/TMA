Hi Jonathan,
Indeed the image regions and annotations in my dataset are represented in a
discrete space: image regions being composed of a visual 'vocabulary' of
SIFT features quantized into clusters, and annotations as textual terms.
Can you point me to some source (or some suggestions) so I can learn about
this implementation in the lda R package?
Thanks,
Mustafa
