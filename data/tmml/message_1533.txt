for 1): MedLDA (or sLDA) just provides ONE very basic way to consider side
information. it can be helpful but is not gauranteed to provide the "ideal"
large improvements you're hoping.
"this works better for regression than for classification": i guess you
misunderstood what we said in the paper. For regression, we observed that
using a supervised LDA as the underlying
topic model is better than using unsupervised one. For classification, we
make this as a hypothesis (but didn't verify it because of time complexity
issue). It doesn't mean using side information is not better than the
methods that don't use.
for 2): MedLDA only introduces one additional parameter C (which is
unavoidable when using SVM). The dirichlet parameter \alpha can be estimated
as in LDA. For cost function \Delta \ell, although we offer you a freedom to
use other cost, you can just use the default 0/1 cost.
