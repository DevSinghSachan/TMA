Greetings List,
I would like to use LDA to discover topics from among the collection of
documents from time to time.
With that said, I am new to whole lot of things including Models,
Algorithms, Java (if talking about advanced levels).
For persons with such requirements and novice background, is there a pointer
to the document(s) using which such implementation can be achieved.
Regards
ydnrao
