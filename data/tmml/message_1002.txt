Hi Donn!
Thank you so much, right now the Gibbs Sampler is running :-)
Actually, there was still a problem. But this was caused by the fact
that the source toolbox's source code files have MsDos-format. The
patch-tool could not handle the 'carriage return' characters at the end
of lines.
Well, now it works! Great!
Best regards,
Sebastian
