Hi everyone,
I do not quite understand why Blei's LDA code considers the parameter
alpha as a scalar so that the learned dirichlet distribution is a
K-dimensional symmetric Dirichlet. In my understanding, the elements in
vector alpha could be different. Can anyone explain for me? Thank you
so much.
Regards,
