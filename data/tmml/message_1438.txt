Roi,
Please take a look at our new paper
David Andrzejewski, Xiaojin Zhu, Mark Craven, and Ben Recht.
A framework for incorporating general domain knowledge into Latent
Dirichlet Allocation using First-Order Logic.
(IJCAI-11), 2011.
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/foldall.pdf
This can be formulated as a simple First-Order Logic preference, something
like
\forall i: z_i=z_{i+1}
or, if you want them to differ,
\forall i: NOT(z_i=z_{i+1})
and the model will attempt to enforce this preference while optimizing the
LDA objective via stochastic optimization.  You can throw in other
preferences pretty easily since all you need to do is to formulate them in
FOL.  David Andrzejewski (http://people.llnl.gov/andrzejewski1) has an
alpha implementation.
Best,
Jerry
