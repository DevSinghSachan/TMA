Hello.
I was trying to compile Correlated Topic Model in Windows with Cygwin. I have installed make,gcc,gsl etc while I was installing the Cygwin. But I got some error messages when I  typed "make" to compile the original codes.
30 errors in total.
such as:
inference.c 56: parse error before ">" token.
