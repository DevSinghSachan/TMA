hi topics list,
regarding initialization of the nested CRP, i do the following:
for each document,
1. associate it with a new branch in the tree, sharing only the root
node
2. sample the topic assignments for each word from
p(z_0) p(z_1 | z_0) ...  p(z_N | z_0 ... z_{N-1}).
3. resample the tree path for the document
it might help to repeat this process a few times and choose the
initial state that has the highest posterior mode.
[ah... i just saw that joseph reisinger suggested a similar
initialization scheme.]
regarding hyperparameters, indeed, the prior on the topic
distributions affects the size of the tree.  a small value of \eta
leads to sparse distributions.  as a consequence, a bushier tree is
needed to explain the data.
once your implementation of the nested CRP is working, i suggest
implementing hyper-parameter updates to search the space of
hyperparameters.  we used metropolis-hastings in our implementation,
with a truncated gaussian proposal.  however, i think that better
methods of approximate inference for dirichlet hyperparameters have
since been developed.  other members of the list might be able to
point us to some.
best,
dave
