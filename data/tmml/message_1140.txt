David's point is important.  Also, remember that real topics are not
multinomial
distributions.  Genuine topics are bursty, but multinomials are not.
A method that assumes
that topics are multinomials need more topics to fit a corpus as well
as a method
that takes into account burstiness.  So you could say that all methods that
use multinomials as topics find too many topics.
For illustrations, see Figures 2 and 3 of the ICML 2009 paper
"Accounting for Word Burstiness in Topic Models,"
