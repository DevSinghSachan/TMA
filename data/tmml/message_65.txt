hi authors,
i see.  thanks for the clarification.
as a practical matter, i suppose that one can compute the norm of the
(approximate) derivative w/r/t phi to assess convergence.  then, use
the taylor approximation at the end if interested in the likelihood
bound.
BTW, why is it a "gaussian" approximation?  to my eyes, you find a
taylor approximation and then take expectations.  the means and
variances are exact.
best,
dave
