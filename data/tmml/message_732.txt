I'm pretty sure the distribution of these is log-concave so you can use
adaptive rejection sampling methods.
We take an entirely different approach, however for this when a full
Dirichlet is used, so for non-symmetric alpha.   You can replace the
Dirichlet by a Dirichlet Process or Pitman-Yor Process and then use an
efficient collapsed Gibbs
sampler.  Lan Du (ANU&NICTA) gets great results using this
(at another spot on the LDA) and its published in ECML-PKDD 2010, this year.
This collapsed Gibbs sampler is about 20 times faster than previous methods
for sampling with a DP or PYP.
