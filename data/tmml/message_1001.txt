Dear all,
I have a doubt in the lda-c code implementation.
in the lda_inference() function, the variational gamma parameter is updated
using the following expression:
var_gamma[k] = var_gamma[k] + doc->counts[n]*(phi[n][k] - oldphi[k]);
However I am not sure about why there is a multiplication by doc->counts[n]?
Only guess that I could make is, it is done to provide appropriate weight.
Is that true? Can someone please provide the exact reason for doing that
multiplication.
regards
