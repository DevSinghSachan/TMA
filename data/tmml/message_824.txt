Hello list members,
I am currently doing some little research on incremental ways of
training LDA model and I am curious if you know of any incremental
variational methods ? I know that there exist incremental Monte Carlo
methods but was unable to find anything on incremental variational
methods. Also, did you explored the problem of variable number of
topics and if how they could appear and disappear over time ? Do you
know of any work related to this problem ?
Thanks,
Mateusz
