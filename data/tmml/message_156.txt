Hi,
I have trained an LDA model on my dataset and I have obtained the
"model.beta", "model.gamma" and "model.alpha" files. By observing the
top words for each topic it is evident that the model has been
successfully trained.
My question is the following:
I have created a new file where I converted the columns of my original
word-document matrix into empirical estimates of the distribution over
words in each document (by dividing its column by its sum).
Calling this matrix P, is it true that I can approximate P by simply
multiplying my ".beta" and ".gamma" files ? (of course after
exponentiating the beta file entries etc...)
This would make sense in pLSI as it is obvious from the equations, but
under LDA I am not sure that this appoximation is valid due to the
additional a priori constraints imposed by the Dirichlet priors.
Thank you in advance.
