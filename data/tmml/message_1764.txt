Hey list!
I am trying to get a test run of nubbi.collapsed.gibbs.sampler running
in R, but keep on getting crashes and the help is, well, not helping.
I'm pretty sure that I'm just misinterpreting one of the input formats
pretty dramatically. So, in a desperate bid for support, I am pinging
the list.
The basic error is:
Error in structure(.Call("nubbi", c(contexts, pair.contexts), sources,  :
source must be a(n) Integer.
My sample texts, values passed to nubbi.collapsed.gibbs.sampler, and
values created by nubbi.collapsed.gibbs.sampler are posted at
http://pastebin.com/j4UXJQFp  Thanks for any & all assistance.
Best,
pml
