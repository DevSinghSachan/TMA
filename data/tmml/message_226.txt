Hello list,
This is hopefully one of last questions as I started understanding the
paper, but I still have some questions left unanswered. Some of the
concerns I am having are
1) what is the role of sufficient statistics and what does "maximum
likelihood estimate with expected sufficient statistic" mean? Sorry if
this sounds stupid but I am not a native speaker so this sounds sort
of too condensed for me.
2) what is the interpretation of \phi and \gamma variational
parameters and how do they relate to \alpha and \beta parameters?
3) in the lda-c implementation what is the meaning of lda_suffstats
structure and class_word and class_total fields?
4) what part of the paper is explaining the sufficient statistic part?
Best,
Mateusz Berezecki
