hi all,
I am a newbie in topic modeling.
I ran parameter estimation on 100 topic model LDA using David blei's C
implementation
on AP corpus(provided along with code).
The value of gamma parameter over different documents and different topic is
0.0076798508 most of the time. Is this supposed to be this way?
Initial value of alpha I had taken was 0.4.
I am also attaching final.gamma file.
Can anyone please tell me whether the values of gamma are expected to be
this way or not.
Sorry ,if the question is so naive.
thanks,
ajai.
