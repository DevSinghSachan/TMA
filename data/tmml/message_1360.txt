Hi -- the standard Gibbs sampler of the LDA model (Griffiths and Steyvers 2004)
has an increased iteration time for the first and partly the second iteration
(depending on K and alpha, about 50%-100% above the third iteration). Is there
literature on this curious phenomenon?
Any ideas?
Best regards
gregor
