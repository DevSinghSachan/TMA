Hi, can anyone tell me how to run the LDA program ? I am getting
segmentation default. I was trying to run the LDA sample code using the
example code.
./lda est fixed 10 /usr/local/lda-c-dist/settings.txt /usr/local/ap/ap.dat
seeded /usr/local/ap/
I am getting error segmentation default. I am running this on sample dataset
given by the site.
Regards,
Prasanna.
