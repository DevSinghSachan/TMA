Hi list,
I'd like to know (with possibly every analytical step and an
explanation of it) how do I get from equation 2 to equation 3 in the
LDA paper.
My reasoning was as follows
p(\theta,z,w|\alpha,\beta) = p(\theta|\alpha)\prod_{n=1}^N
p(z_n|\theta)p(w_n|z_n,\beta) [1]
to get but in order to get p(w | \alpha, \beta) which is a marginal
distribution I have to get rid of z and w variables.
Proceeding in that manner we first get
p(w|\alpha,\beta) = \int\sum_{z} p(\theta, z, w|\alpha,\beta) d\theta
Rewriting the right side using [1] we get
\int\sum_{z} p(\theta, z, w|\alpha,\beta) d\theta =
\int\sum_{z}p(\theta|\alpha)\prod_{n=1}^N
p(z_n|\theta)p(w_n|z_n,\beta)d\theta
And the right hand side is equal to
\int p(\theta|\alpha)\sum_{z}\prod_{n=1}^N p(z_n|\theta)p(w_n|z_n,\beta)d\theta
because of moving the p(\theta | \alpha) term out of the sum. But this
is still different from:
\int p(\theta|\alpha)\prod_{n=1}^N\sum_{z_n}
p(z_n|\theta)p(w_n|z_n,\beta)d\theta
How do I get the product of the sums under the integral from equation
2 instead of getting the sum of the products?
I think I am missing something...
best,
Mateusz
