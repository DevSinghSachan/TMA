Chi --
There is some additional overhead with doing the FastLDA computation.
But this overhead becomes small compared to the savings due to doing
<< T loops inside the Gibbs sampler.  The savings will increase for
increasing T and decreasing \alpha.  So you should eventually see a
speedup (I'm not surprised you are not seeing a speedup for T=15).
Code for FastLDA can be found here:
