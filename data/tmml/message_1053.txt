Hello Toyin,
I only understood half of what you said, but if you want to convert between different file formats for unsupervised learning (including LDA-C), have a look at:
http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projekty/gensim/tut1.html#corpus-formats
That package also includes the TF-IDF transformation that you mentioned.
Hope that helps,
Radim
