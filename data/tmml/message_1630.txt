I am trying to use Chong Wang's implementation of hdp for topic modeling. I
will need to compute the document-topic and topic-word distributions from
the files generated by hdp.  With that in mind, I have questions about the
files used for and generated from hdp and print.topics.r.
- What's the difference between the mode-*.dat files, such as
mode-topics.dat, and the dat files that start with numbers, such as
00400-topics.dat? Are the mode files the final files after the algorithm
stops and the number files ones generated while the inference algorithm is
running?
- What is the format of the vocab.dat file used in print.topics.r? I
think that it's supposed to be one word per line where the order matches the
term numbers used in the LDA-C format, but I'm not sure.
- This question may have a more obvious answer, but I'll ask anyway just
to make sure. Does each line of a *-word-assignments.dat file tell me the
topic that a word is assigned to for each document?
- To compute the document-topic and word-topic distributions from the
files generated by hdp, I don't think I need the table index from the
*-word-assignments.dat files. Is that correct?
- Where do I obtain the topics.dat file used in print.topics.r?
- What is the format of the topics.dat file used in print.topics.r?
Thanks,
Josh
