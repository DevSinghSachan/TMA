Dear Sir,
I am one of the users of the code of lda [lda-c] and hierarchial-lda
[hlda-c] provided on the website. I am using it on ubuntu.
The code compiles fine but is not being able to execute. When I use the
command lda [...] [...].. .. .. ..
It says that 'lda' command does not exist.
Please help me out.
