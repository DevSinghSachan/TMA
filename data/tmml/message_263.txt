Hi David,
That has been my experience with setting eta values as well, (in terms of
number of branches). If such is the case, are you, or anyone else on this
list, aware of a method of initializing the tree that might avoid the "giant
branch" (tree trunk) scenario? It seems, from a reading of the original
paper, that this outcome is not to be expected.
Cheers,
David
PS I am also looking for an implementation of PAM that I could play around
with -- is there one available?
