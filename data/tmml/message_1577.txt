Hi evergyone,
In the EMNLP 2007 paper "Improving Word Sense Disambiguation Using Topic
Features", there is conclusion that
"The $\gamma$ parameter provides an approximation to the probability of
selecting topic i in the document", which is
the Eq. (1) in the paper, i.e. $p(z_i | \gamma)=frac{gamma_i}{sum_K \gamma
_k}$.
I don't understand Eq. (1) and its explanation, and the author gave no
further answer.
And I read the Blei et al 2003 again, I have not found any such conclusion.
Any suggestion will be of appreciated.
Best regards,
Yun Zhou
