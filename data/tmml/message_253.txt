hi thomas and all,
i wasn't able to recreate your problem on my computer.  i ran the
following command:
./ctm est ../ap/ap.dat 5 seed AP-TEST/ settings.txt
and it worked fine.  is this what you tried?
however, i did find a memory leak and a bug with "rand"
initialization.  these are fixed and there is a new version of ctm-c
on-line at

best,
dave
