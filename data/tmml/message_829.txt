Hi, all
I am new to LDA and this maillist. I am trying to use LDA in an application,
but I got a problem with it, could you please help me?
By giving topic number to LDA the word-topic assignments can be obtained,
but in fact I have the topic description in hand, such as "architecture"
"history". How can I know which is the correspondent topic descrition for
the number or label I got?
Thanks a lot!
