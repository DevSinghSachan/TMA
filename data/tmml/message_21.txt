Dear list members,
for a community matching task ("supply" against "interest"), I'd like to
have some test data. Unfortunately I couldn't seem to locate any data
set. The corpus should include:
- textual or other features document content (ok, this is simple)
- who wrote it (still available, NIPS, CiteSeer etc.)
- who searched it, recommended it and/or was otherwise interested in
it. (This seems to be the hard part).
As an addition, it would be interesting to have an internal structure of
the people (social network) and documents (document citation graph or
hyperlink structure). A peer-to-peer community corpus with content
features would certainly help. Text would be preferred, but if it's some
other content features (Gaussian mixtures etc.), it would be nice, too.
Has anybody an idea where to get such a corpus -- or by merging
different sets -- synthesise one?
'd be great.
Best,
gregor
