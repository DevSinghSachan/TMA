Dickson,
frankly, I don't think you learn how topic modes work from looking at
the source code.
Furthermore, I found the topic model implementation based on
mean-field-approximation used by David Blei (I guess this is the version
you found) is much more complicated to get than the topic models with a
gibbs sampling implementation (although mean field implementations are
faster).
A good introductory article on topic models with gibbs sampling can be
found here
http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/SteyversGriffithsLSABookFormatted.pdf
For details on how to derive a sampler from the generative model
description I recommend this:
http://www.arbylon.net/publications/text-est.pdf but I can also give you
my notes on this.
For advanced reading on variational methods for graphical models see
here

Hope this helps,
Laura
