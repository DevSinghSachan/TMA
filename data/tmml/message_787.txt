hi lara
(+ cc the group)
yes that R code is correct.  for computing the entire set of probabilities
at once, consider using apply or---even better---hadley wickham's plyr
package (aaply).  if "gammas" is the D x K gamma matrix, the probabilities
are:
gammas <- gammas - alpha
thetas <- aaply(gammas, 1, function (row) (row)/sum(row))
thetas will be a D x K matrix of probabilities.  (note: aaply is not a typo.
that is the command in plyr.)
