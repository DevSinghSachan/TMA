Dear All,
This is my first post to this list. I am starting to learn topic modeling,
and trying to run the lda-c package authored by Blei.  I have two questions
with respect to the input format,
1)      Given a large collection of plain text file, is there any existing
utility/script to transfer these files into the required format of lda-c
package?
2)      How to generate the vocab file?
Many thanks for the help.
Wen
