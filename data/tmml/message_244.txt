Dear All,
I read the paper about CorrLDA (Modeling annotated data). I had some
problems.
Suppose that we can use Gibbs sampling to do inference, does sampling a
topic for region have something to do with probabilistic distribution of
topic and caption words?
Actually region and word and be seen as different type of objects. We
can change these objects in the model and choose different distributions to
model topic and object. Suppose that we can model topic region with
multinomial distribution, Gibbs sampling can be easily utilized. I do not
know whether my understanding is right or not.
What is the conditional probability of p(z|z-, r, w)?  Does it have
three terms (with one more term about topic word distribution ) or two terms
(like LDA)?
Do I make myself clear?
Thanks for your help.
