Thanks David
I have tried using them. The main problem with Mallet is its very heavy. The RAM
usage is high for large corpora.
I am interested in the Mahout's PLDA implementation because it uses Mapreduce
and can be run on Yahoo hadoop clusters or the Amazon clusters.
Currently I am trying to see if there people who have tried the Mahout and how
they infer document proportions for large corpora.
