Hello,
The paper mentions that due to the non-conjugacy of the distribution
(log-normal and multinomial), it is hard/not possible to construct a
Gibbs sampler for the CTM, and a Metropolis-Hastings sampler would
have to be used. I haven't heard of any such implementations though -
the one Tanmoy linked to uses variational bayes.
Cheers,
