hi david,
yes, the gibbs sampler for the model is conservative.  ideally, we
could integrate out the z variables in sampling the c variables.
however, that integral is intractable.
you are essentially suggesting to approximate it with sampling.  i
think that this is a very good idea, and it might really improve the
algorithm.
best,
dave
