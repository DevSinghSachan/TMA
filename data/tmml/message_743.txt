Hi Govind,
The format of the links is a list, one-element per document in
your corpus.  The list item associated with a document is an integer vector of
the indices of the documents this document is linked to.  The entries should
be 0-indexed, that is, the first document is 0.  See 'cora.cites', included in
the package for an example.
To read this from a file, you can just do
something like:
lines <- readLines("your file")
links <-
lapply(strsplit(lines, " ", fixed = T), as.integer)
Although this depends
on the specifics of the format of your file (the above should work if the data
in the file is also 0-indexed and delimited by spaces).
Cheers,
Jonathan
