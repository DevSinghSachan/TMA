I completely agree with David's comment, and can give some context.  I
do a lot of topic modeling work of (e.g. NSF) grant proposals.  Even
if I'm modeling a collection of 100,000 grants, a "useful" number
of topics will be different for different users.
For, say, the head of NSF, ~100 topics may be useful to understand
broadly what is being funded.
For, say, a researcher in microRNA, maybe ~1000 topics will be useful
to tease apart the different facets of research related to microRNA.
If you're not directly interested in topics themselves (and using them
for some downstream task) you can certainly go ahead and learn the
number of topics to optimize task performance.
