Dear list members,
I am just curious to know what tool/software/language people usually use
for implementing Gibbs sampling for topic model like generative framework?
Is it more convenient to work with R, OPENBUGS, MALLET or FACTORIE rather
than writing code on C/C++/Java/MATLAB? I am currently working with a
dataset which has few millions of documents. So, I have to think of the
scalability of the implementations as well. Recently, I developed some code
in MATLAB for smoothened LDA and discovered that MATLAB can't handle the
enormous size of the dataset unless the documents are read sequentially in
groups. Migrating over C/C++ is not that advantageous as I have to write
codes for constrained optimization which is somewhat painful. So, I was just
thinking if I can work with some standard library functions with some other
tool that will also provide me enough flexibility in handling this large
dataset. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated.
Thanks,
Ayan Acharya
