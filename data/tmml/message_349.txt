Dear Friends:
I am working on HDP for text processing.
I make such model (In fact, it is Dirichlet Process Mixture Model)
H = Dirichlet(b/W,.., b/W)
G ~ DP(\alpha;H)
\theta_i ~ G
xi ~ Multinomial(ni ; \theta_i )
1) each paper (xi) in document is represented as a vector of size W (W is
number of words in vocabulary)
each element in this vector is number of occurrence of corresponding word
2) each paper (vector xi) is drawn from multinomial distribution with
parameter (\theta_i)
3) prior distribution of \theta_i is symmetric Dirichlet H
I have some problems:
How to construct a HDP model (instead of DPM) for text processing from DPM?
What is the corresponding concept to tables, restraunt, \theta in HDP
paper(Yee 2006) to our text processing domain?
Can you recommend some reference to me?
Thank you very much for your kind help and look forward to your reply!
