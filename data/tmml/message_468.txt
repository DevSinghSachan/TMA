Dear list,
I am wondering if the idea of variational inference with incompletely
factorized q(x) has been explored in the "topic-model" literature.
Example: q(Z) = q(z1,z2) prod_{i>=3} q(z_i) with q(z1,z2) some
two-dimensional multinomial.
Whenever such a constraint may improve results ([1] have shown this in a
different setting), blocked Gibbs for dependent latent variables seems
to be the solution of choice. Of course, derivation and inference may be
simpler to implement, but is it also a matter of tractability in
real-size problems (compared to GS)?
Any hints or practical experience?
Thanks and best regards
gregor
