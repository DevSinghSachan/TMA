Hi
Recently, I have read Blei's paper and the C implementation of LDA, here are
some questions I don?t understand.
1?While reading the JMLR version of the LDA paper, I have a question that
is, In the Eq. 7?the N >= document.length , Am I right?
2?the routine of  lda_inference( )  in Prof Blei's LDA C codes
If I initialize varGamma[k] = model.getAlpha()
Then the update can be computed as follows
varGamma[k] = varGamma[k] + doc.getCount(n) * phi[n][k]
is that right, can anybody help me?
Thanks
