Hi, all.
i am using the LDA model for my researching, i wonder know whether the
document generated by this model can be used like this:
for example, we have a document d="aaa  bbb ccc ddd", after using LDA model
this document was annotated by its generative topic,
providing that there are 3 topic here, and dnew="aaa(topic 1) bbb(topic 2)
ccc(topic 2) ddd(topic 3)"
in addition, the document was project into 3 different views according the
topic annotation, so 3 views for document d:
d_view1="aaa(topic 1)"  d_view2="bbb(topic 2) ccc(topic 2)"
d_view3="ddd(topic 3)"
in the same way, the whole documents collection can be projected into
different views ralated to the topics detected by LDA model.
and for each documents view collection, clustering the document views for
each topic to get the sub-topics with the usual methods in Vector Space
Model(tf-idf....)
now the problems come out,
is it reasonable to treat the document view as a nomal document written by
human beings?
or the premise for using VSM is that the document can only be directly
written by human beings?
i am waiting for your opinions(~o_o~).
