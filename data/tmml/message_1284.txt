Hi All,
I am working with some topic model like framework (Bayesian Cluster
Ensemble by Wang et al) and encountered a situation where the posterior of
hidden variables corresponding to different data points comes out to be
same. Is that possible and if it is a common problem with mean field
approximations, is there a way out (other than Gibbs sampling of course)?
Thanks,
Ayan Acharya
