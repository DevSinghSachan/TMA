I completely concur with popular topics ending up in a large number of
similar topics. While I only did some initial exploration, I
hypothesize that similarity metrics could auto-collapse some of the
topics. This is a bit like Mallet's hyperparameter optimization,
except it would actually reduce K. I've had great success with
distance metrics like Hellinger being able to find related topics,
although that isn't necessarily the same thing as collapsing topics.
What might prove useful to some is my answer to the technical portion
of my general exams.  In it I had to surveyed published methods of
evaluating topic models, in addition to coming up with some of my own
(for specific problem domains).  It can be found here:

While I did indeed pass, I cannot guarantee any of it is correct :)
