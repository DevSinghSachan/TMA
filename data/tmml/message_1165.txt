Hi Anthony --
such a thing is surely possible but not necessarily the most natural choice: The
assumption that topic models and topic maps are related concepts or methods is a
common misconception. Both methods have in common that they aim at simplifying
access to content by adding some sort of meta-data that may then be used as a
basis for navigation or retrieval.
It's coincidence that I was drafting text on a related topic just the other
day... So here's the gist:
In a topic map, you want to relate given concepts to facilitate access, and
there exists an abstract structure / data model. A topic in this context refers
to a concept, in an ontology sense.
Conversely, a topic model does not imply such an abstract structure. You rather
assume a model that the observed data may be explained with. A topic in this
context is a probability distribution over observable features (terms), and in
many cases in such distributions, likely terms are semantically related. In the
majority of topic models, the concepts are not known a priori and are learned
