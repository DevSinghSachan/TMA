Hi,
in the npbayes matlab code the hyper prior H is just a fixed symmetric
Dirichlet prior. As far as I know H is not optimized, it is fixed. To
get the MAP estimate of the multinomial parameters you just add the word
counts to the pseudo counts from the Dirichlet distribution and
normalize it.
The optimization of the hyper parameters \gamma, and \alpha_{0} is
described in the appendix of the Teh el al. paper.
