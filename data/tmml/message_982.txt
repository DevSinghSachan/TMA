I am still a new to Factorie, but the model code in factorie would not
be much longer than the HBC code. I guess something like one line HBC
code refers to 3 lines Factorie code (as opposed to 100 lines Gibbs
sampling code in java).
However, you trade that for a lot of flexibility. If you head out for
scalable algorithms, this flexibility of hacking the inference is
actually what you need...
Cheers,
