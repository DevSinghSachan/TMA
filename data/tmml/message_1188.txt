Hi Ayan,
The framework we used in that paper counts words and tags as essentially
equal weight observations (although in different "channels").  I think there
are a few ways you could formalize the idea of giving different weights to
the different observation types.  In general, you'd start by introducing a
different parameter for each information channel's topic mixture (so one
theta for tags and another for words).  Then you have some flexibility in
choosing how your model should tie these parameters together to get the
properties you want (e.g. maybe a shared prior, maybe a learned convex
mixture, etc).
Good luck,
dan
