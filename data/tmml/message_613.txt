Here's some more context for these ideas - the Hutter Prize for text
compression:

and Matt Mahoney's research:
http://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/
especially the rationale for the compression benchmark:

It would be quite interesting to see how a topic model does on or
contributes to an approach to these types of benchmarks, especially
for the sake of seeing how well long-range dependencies can be modeled
by them and how much they contribute to good predictions.
