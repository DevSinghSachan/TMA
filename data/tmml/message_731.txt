Hi --
Thanks Arthur, the appendix to the distributed LDA paper is exactly what
I've been looking for. No need to re-invent the wheel then...
Thanks also for answers by Laura Dietz and Alexandre Passos. For this
list as a record, here's a list of pointers:
- Hanna Wallach's PhD thesis:
http://www.cs.umass.edu/~wallach/theses/wallach_phd_thesis.pdf -->
contains slice sampling (beside a thorough treatment of non-random
estimation methods); Mallet  contains some implementations.
- Arthur Asuncion et al.:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~asuncion/pubs/UAI_09.pdf --> notably the MAP
version of Minka's ML estimator and a comparison of different methods.
- Mark Johnson's work.
Best regards
gregor
