Hello all,
I am trying to use the CTM library provided on the website. I am not able to
compile it since it needs atlas library to compile.
I downloaded atlas library from
http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/atlas_install/
But I am facing problem installing it, even though I tried through root
login.
Can anybody help me regarding which library I should install for
successfully compiling ctm?
Regards,
Bhavana
