In response to David Mimno's questions:
Well, one needs to develop the mean field approximation.
Other than using Ghahramani and Beal's elegant formulation
("Propagation Algorithms for Variational {B}ayesian Learning", 2000),
which makes mean-field simple, I cannot really say much.
We've adopted the "left-to-right sequential sampler" for some
other topic models, but not the mean-field importance
sampler.  I expect the mean-field importance sampler could
have more general uses.
Well, the standard variational method for LDA looks at the
distribution of the document proportions.  This instead looks at
the distribution of word topics.  The standard variational method
has a nice solution, whereas the one of Eq. 4 is an approximation.
But, in our case, for importance sampling of the word topics,
Eq 4 is sampling what we need.  The standard LDA variational approach
doesn't help here, it is sampling the wrong variables.
Not sure I've helped here ;-)
