I found that open bugs is not meant for large scale inference issues.
But maybe it improved in the past few years.
I havent tried the Jonathan's R package. I feel that if you want
something that scales, you should go with a native compiled language. I
don't know whether it is a pure R or a native implementation.
I tried Hal's HBC. I guess it is well tested for LDA and compiles to
native C, which is a big plus. However, for some topic model extensions,
I found that the generated code does sometimes not compile, so I needed
to fix it manually.
One might also consider using Infer.NET, which scales okay for LDA, but
may need hacking for more complicated models. (I heard they are working
on a new release, in which many scalability issues are addressed.)
Cheers,
Laura
