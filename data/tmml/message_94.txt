Hi Neal,
You might be interested in this paper from JCDL 2007:
Organizing the OCA: Learning faceted subjects from a library of digital
books. David Mimno and Andrew McCallum.
http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mimno/papers/f129-mimno.pdf
We run topic models in parallel over books, each subdivided into pages,
and then tie each of the book-specific models together with shared topic
hyperparameters.
Another similar approach with hierarchical Dirichlets is presented in
Distributed Inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation
