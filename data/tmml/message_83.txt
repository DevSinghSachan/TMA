Hello list,
I have a question about the collapsed variational Bayes method for
inference presented in
http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~ywteh/research/inference/nips2006.pdf. I
have understood the rationale behind using a collapsed version of VB
and I have understood (well, I have a rough figure rather than a full
understanding) the update equation. What I have not understood is how
do you implement a stopping rule for the updates. Do you calculate the
likelihood, in a similar fashion to LDA? If so, how? Can be
convergence assessed in another way?
I also haven't understood completely how do you initialize the \gamma
variables, but I suppose that sampling from a symmetric Dirichlet
should do the trick.
Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
Matteo Dimai
