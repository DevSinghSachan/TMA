Hi Topic Modelers,
I have recently made a few changes to the Dynamic Topic Models source code
and updated the appropriate download (
http://code.google.com/p/princeton-statistical-learning/downloads).  One of
these changes was intended to fix a nonsense evidence lower bound; one
addressed slow topic initialization, which could lead to poor (or identical)
topics in the end; and one fixed bug in assessing convergence.
Thanks go to Alex Kulesza and William Darling for pointing out these
issue(s) and suggested fixes.
Best,
Sean
