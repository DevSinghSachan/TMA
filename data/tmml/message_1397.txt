Hi Sean,
the content of documents
I was wondering if you have specific references for this ? I've
certainly seen a handful of papers on various usages of topic model from
folks at Google Research (e.g. ?Modeling Online Reviews with Multi-Grain
Topic Models?, which might be the one you're alluding to ?) but I'm also
interested in hearing about systems that are effectively used in a
production setting.
