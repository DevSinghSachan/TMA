Hi guys!
I would like to use LDA in a setting, where I have a comprehensive
vocabulary of 10.000-100.000 words and only a limited number of
documents, i.e. 100-1.000. My intuition is that this will work badly and
take a lot of time for the inference of the model, right!? Especially
the limited amount of documents might be problematic. Do you still think
that this might give some useful results?
Best regards,
Sebastian
