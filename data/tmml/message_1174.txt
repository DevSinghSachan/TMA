This isn't quite true, for two reasons. First, in most situations it's
not practical to implement slice sampling by sampling uniformly from
the slice, and so some less aggressive update has to be used that
merely leaves the uniform distribution invariant (that you can do this
is the big idea in Neal's 2003 paper on the subject). Second, even if
you can compute the boundaries of the slice analytically slice
sampling still usually needs a few iterations to fully mix over the
range of possible densities. For example, if you start in a region of
very high density it's unlikely that a single iteration of slice
sampling will take you to a region of low density, even if that region
is enormous and has a ton of mass (e.g. if you're working with a
heavy-tailed distribution).
That said, in many cases replacing a Gibbs update with a single slice
sampling iteration works great, and this could totally be one of them.
Best,
Matt
