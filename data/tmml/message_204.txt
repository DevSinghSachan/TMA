Hey List,

My feeling is that the label-switching problem is unlikely to happen in
LDA-gibbs samplers. (For a reasonable number of iterations.) If only one
topic association is resampled at a time, it is rather unlikely that all
words from topic 2 move to topic 3 after some iterations.
For that reason, one may average samples (at least within a window of
some iterations).  (For example the citation influence model, nearly
always yielded same results.)
Alternatively, one may evaluate the likelihood function for a number of
iterations, and choose point estimates that yield the highest
likelihood. (Or use this in combination with averaging)
Does anyone has further thoughts on this?
Cheers,
