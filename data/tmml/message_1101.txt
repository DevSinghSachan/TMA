Hello,
Maybe this is a minor point, but I've been thinking about it.
Is there any reason why the sLDA model has the class output depend on z bar
instead of directly on ?? After all,
E[z bar] = ?.
And it seems cleaner to depend on the topic mixture for the document rather
than the topics the actual words come from.
Thank you,
