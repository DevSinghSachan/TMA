Does anyone know if the code to estimate the model presented in
A Joint Topic and Perspective Model for Ideological Discourse
with Eric Xing, and Alexander Hauptmann, 2008 European Conference on
Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in
Databases (ECML/PKDD)
is available?
With thanks,
Scott Moser
