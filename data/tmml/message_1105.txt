Hi, folks,
I have two questions:
1 why LDA does not using the Expectation Maximization method to inference the hidden
variable, just as PLSA does.
2 Is it worthwhile to make a evaluation on the several approaches for LDA inference?
They include the Laplace approximation, higher-order variation techniques, and Monte
Carlo method and the variational inference used by David M. Blei.
Regards.
Charly.
