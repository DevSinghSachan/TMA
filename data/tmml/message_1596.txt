Dear All,
Sorry for the bother.  I know the issue of 'choosing the number of
topics' is an often asked (and kindly, patiently answered) question
posted here but I have a potential 'twist' on the issue.  Do any
special considerations arise when selecting the number of topics in a
dynamic topic model?  Specifically, I would like to evaluate the
performance of the Dynamic Topic Model and the Continuous Dynamic
Topic Model each with varying number of topics.  To start with: are
there specific guidelines for choosing hyper parameters in DTM and
cDTM? ( I would like to compare 'well fit' models to each other, and
presumably, hyper parameters might need to change depending on the
number of topics).    I am aware of the useful suggestions and
articles offered on this list for the general issue of 'choosing the
number of topics' but wanted if the advise offered there ports
directly to settings in which one is modeling the evolution of topics
over time.
