Dear topics-models list,
I'm sorry for the perhaps remedial question, but I am having some difficulty
using the 'turbotopics' code provided.  There are three python scripts,
lda_topics.py, compute_ngrams.py and turbotopics.py.  The readme file
describes only the first two.
By question is:
I understand (well, i think) that to actually find the 'turbotopics' (that
is, to find a list of n-grams that are representative of each topic in an
LDA or CTM), one would run
python lda_topics.py --assign=word-assignments.dat --corpus=corpus.txt
