Hi Liu Qi,
The transition operator T is closely related to Gibbs sampling. You might
want to review sampling-based inference -- the Griffiths and Steyvers
paper is a good place to start.
The topic indicator variables z are not known, but if you have values for
them, the Gibbs sampling update equation tells you how to resample each z
given the values of the other z's. The transition operator T just means
going through all the z's from beginning to end. It turns out that the
reverse operator \tilde{T} just amounts to doing the same thing, but from
the end to the beginning.
That tells you how to move from one set of z's to another, but where do
you start? The amazing (to me, at least) thing about Gibbs sampling is
that you can start with random values, and they will eventually converge
to samples from a posterior distribution defined by T.
The gamma function is basically a factorial, so computing it and then
taking a log will overflow very quickly. The trick is to calculate log
gamma(x) directly. There are many methods for calculating quick, accurate
approximations to this function. Here's the one I've found works best, as
implemented in MALLET:
/** Use a fifth order Stirling's approximation.
*      @param z Note that Stirling's approximation is
*      increasingly unstable as <code>z</code> approaches 0. If
*      <code>z</code> is less than 2, we shift it up,
*      calculate the approximation, and then shift the answer
*      back down.
*/
public static double logGammaStirling(double z) {
int shift = 0;
while (z < 2) {
z++;
shift++;
double result = HALF_LOG_TWO_PI + (z - 0.5) * Math.log(z) - z +
1/(12 * z) - 1 / (360 * z * z * z) + 1 / (1260 * z * z * z * z * z);
while (shift > 0) {
shift--;
z--;
result -= Math.log(z);
return result;
