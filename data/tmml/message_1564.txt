Hi,
I have gone through the research paper on Corr-LDA, and am planning on using
Corr-LDA for annotation of medical imaging data. However, I could not find
any implementation of Corr-LDA on the web, or in the lda package on the CRAN
database.
Can anyone, who has worked with Corr-LDA, point me to relevant links of such
an implementation (other than in R), or any user manual where I can get
instructions on how to implement this in CRAN lda package (the former option
would be more preferable)?
Thanks,
Mustafa
