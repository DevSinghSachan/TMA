Hi All,
I'm understanding Dirichlet processes a lot better now, but this
sentence has been bedeviling me for awhile: "Draws from a Dirichlet
process are discrete with probability one"  I don't understand what it
would mean for the draw to have some "probability" of being discrete -
I would think it either was or wasn't.  How does a probability come
into it, and  where's the "meta-distribution" that rules on that?  I
also sometimes see statements like "stick-breaking priors are almost
surely discrete".  Why not "probability one"?
I also sometimes get confused about which is the "draw" and which is
the "process".   Is the "draw" the infinite stick-breaking sequence of
weighted point masses, and the "process" the distribution G(alpha,G0),
OR is that infinite sequence the "process", and a given one of the
point masses the "draw"?    Being infinite and iterated, the sequence
seems like a "process" to me, but I've got a feeling this isn't
right...
thanks,
Dave
