Dear topic modelers,
I have implemented hLDA although I seem to be getting rather strange
results. In one case, a 4 level MAP tree was generated wherein the top three
levels had one node each. For some reason, all of the function words
congregated in the lowest of these three nodes (rather than the highest).
There were four children of the third node, two of which were empty of
words. I ran the code for 10,000 iterations.
In another case, I had a 3-level tree where many of the nodes on the bottom
level were empty. Most paths had very few documents (10 or less, with most
having only one), with the exception of one path that had the vast majority
of documents. Could this be due to my hyperparameter settings? (they were
all set to 1).
I'd appreciate any insight into why this might be happening.
Thanks!
David
