Dear all,
I am reading the code of Correlated Topic Models (D. Blei and J. Lafferty,
NIPS 2006). In the code, mean parameter of logistic normal distribution
theta is used to calculate the log probability of the document rather than
the natural parameter eta.
The paper only mentioned this with equation 3:
eta_i = log theta_i / theta_K
and with the word "Notice that this is not the minimal exponential family
representation of the multinomial because multiple values of eta can yield
the same mean parameter."
I am still confused about this, could anyone elaborate on this? What is the
difference using natural parameter and the mean parameter when calculating
the log probability of the document?
Thank you very much!
