Hi All,
I am a student working with LDA for video analysis using David Blei's implementation in C language. We estimate the alpha. The problem is that, the hyperparamer alpha becomes a very large number (> 2000) after trained. Is there anyone can tell me what will cause this problem and how to solve it?
Thanks.
Best wishes.
