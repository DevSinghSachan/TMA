Jon,
Thanks; this is pretty much what I thought, but it's good to have it
confirmed.  One more question (for you or anybody else who cares to
reply): Would it correct to say that the Chinese Restaurant Process is
a special case of the Dirichlet process in which the base distribution
is a uniform, discrete, infinite distribution over the integers (or
equivalent, any other countably infinite set)?
thanks,
Dave
