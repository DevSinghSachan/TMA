Hi,
Aaron: what do you mean by "performed the best" here? Also, how do you
interpret something like JS-divergence "performing better" when it
isn't a metric?
Robin: I am not sure what you mean by 'metric' being a poor choice of
terminology -- I think when people are using the term in this context,
they mean metric in the mathematical sense (at least I did).
Thanks,
Neal
