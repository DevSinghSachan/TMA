Hello,
Thanks. I downloaded the BUGS script for LDA from that site, but it was
intended for fixed-length documents and therefore useless.
This Java code seems very promising though. Any version in a faster
language, C perhaps? I'm working in Python, so something in that
language would also work well.
Best regards,
Matteo Dimai
