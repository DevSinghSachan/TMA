Hi Dan, Hi Corey,
As timestamps t_{di} are drawn from a Beta, they have to be normalized
to [0,1]. (see Step 2c in the generative process)
The Beta distribution has some configurations for which sampling values
0 or 1 are actually fairly high. (Wikipedia has some examples) Hope is
that the parameters are learned to capture whether a topic is hot near
the ends of your time range.
Method of moments estimators game me quite some head ache in terms of
stability/robustness. Sometimes I get extreme values eventually
resulting in NaN. I switched to one of the other hyperparameter
estimation method (e.g. Tom Minka's histogramm method), which are also
part of mallet.
Cheers,
Laura
