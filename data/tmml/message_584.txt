Hi,
I have downloaded the c code for lda and could run it. However, I have a
doubt regarding the values of alpha. In the paper by Blei (Latent Drichlet
Allocation), alpha is a k-vector with components alpha_i>0. However, in the
code, we are required to fill only a single value for alpha. Is alpha
assumed to be a k-vector with all the values being same? or it is a scalar?
Thanks in Advance
