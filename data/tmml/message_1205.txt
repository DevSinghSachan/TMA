Hello,
I have a question regarding averaging information from
multiple Gibbs sampling chains for LDA.
I understand that to estimate the p(w|t) and p(t|d)
distributions we burn in for NNNN iterations
and then take samples every NNN iterations.
What if we have two different chains. There may be
similar topics in both chains but they will have different
ids. Exchangeability means that the model allows
arbitrary perm of the rows of phi AND cols of theta.
However, we could find a matching? between the
topic ids in the two chains and average together the
information from both chains.
Are there any papers that use this approach?

? : In the following paper, they use the KL divergence and the
Hungarian algorithm to find a minimal matching. Over 75% of
the topics were "well matched" between runs with different seed.
