Call For Papers: *International Workshop on **Social Web Mining*, co-located
with IJCAI, Barcelona, Spain, 18 July 2011

***********************************************************************************************************
*Introduction*:
There is increasing interest in social web mining, as we can see from the
ACM workshop on Social Web Search and Analysis. It is not until recently
that great progresses have been made in mining social network for various
applications, e.g., making personalized recommendations. This workshop
focuses on the study of diverse aspects of social networks with their
applications in domains including mobile recommendations, service providers,
electronic commerce, etc.
Social networks have actually played an important role in different domains
for about a decade, particularly in recommender systems. In general,
traditional collaborative filtering approaches can be considered as making
personalized recommendations based on implicit social interaction, where
social connections are defined by some similarity metrics on common rated
items, e.g., movies for the Netflix Prize.
With the recent development of Web 2.0, there emerges a number of globally
deployed applications for explicit social interactions, such as Facebook,
Flickr, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. These applications have been exploited by
academic institutions and industries to build modern recommender systems
based on social networks, e.g., Microsoft's Project Emporia that recommends
tweets to user based on their behaviors.
In recent years, rapid progress has been made in the study of social
networks for diverse applications. For instance, researchers have proposed
various tensor factorization techniques to analyze user-item-tag data in
Flickr for group recommendations. Also, researchers study Facebook to infer
users' preferences.
However, there exist many challenges in mining social web and its
application in recommender systems. Some are:
?      What is the topology of social networks for some specific application
like LinkedIn?
?      How could one build optimal models for social networks such as
Facebook?
?      How can one handle the privacy issue caused by utilizing social
interactions for making recommendation?
?      How could one model a user's preferences based on his/her social
interactions?
We hope to gather scientific researchers and industry in order to discuss
the challenges, exchange ideas, and promote collaborations across different
groups.
*Topics*:
The workshop will seek submissions that cover social networks, data mining,
machine learning, and recommender systems. The workshop is especially
interested in papers that focus on applied domains such as web mining,
mobile recommender systems, social recommender systems, and privacy in
social web mining. The following list provides examples of the types of
areas in which we encourage submissions. The following comprises a sample,
but not complete, listing of topics:
?      Active learning
?      Matchmaking
?      Mobile recommender systems
?      Multi-task learning
?      Learning graph matching
?      Learning to rank
?      Online and contextual advertising
?      Online learning
?      Privacy in social networks
?      Preference learning or elicitation
?      Social network mining
?      Social summarization
?      Tag recommendation
?      Transfer learning
?      Web graph analysis
*Program*:
The workshop program consists of four invited talks, a number of oral
presentations, a poster session, and a panel discussion session. Detailed
