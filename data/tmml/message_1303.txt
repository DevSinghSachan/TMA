Dear All,
Is anyone familiar with the literature Latent Dirichlet Co-clustering
(LDCC: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1193349)? The authors employ
Gibbs sampling for inference and avoids V-EM for local maxima problem. Can
anyone give me an idea of how difficult it is to get out of the local maxima
in V-EM in a hierarchical topic model like framework like LDCC? I am
familiar with Hanna Wallach's work on "Rethinking LDA - why priors matter"
Thanks,
Ayan Acharya
