Hi Halil,
The .gamma file contains one vector (\gamma) per line. Normalize this vector
to get the topic mixture (\theta) using
\theta_i = \frac{\gamma_i}{\sum_{j} \gamma_j}.
The LDA model does not really give the topic mixture (\theta) that generated
the document. Instead, it gives a prior distribution Dirichlet(\gamma) on
the random variable \theta. The equation above calculates the mean value of
this distribution, which is `as good as it gets'.
