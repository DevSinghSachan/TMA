Dear list experts --
I was wondering whether someone has used or published a Monte-Carlo
approach for the parameter of the exchangeable Dirichlet distribution
(LDA's scalar alpha).
I am especially interested in auxiliary-variable variants of the method
of Escobar and West (1995), instead of for instance adaptive rejection
sampling (for performance reasons).
Has anybody used such an approach yet, actually?
Thanks and best regards
gregor
