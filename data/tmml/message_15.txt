Hey ...
I am new to the topic modeling field. I have implemented EM to estimate
the parameters for a mixture multinomial model assumption (as described in
the attachment) on a synthetic data of 200 words (with the frequency of ith
word being set to i%6 + 1 and 5 classes). The initial topic priors and word
topic probabilities were initialized randomly. Suprisingly I haven't
observed any changes in the parameter values after the second iteration.
The output file is also attached. What explains this phenomenon? or is it
a bug in my math or program?
Thanks,
Jags
