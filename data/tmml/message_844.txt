Hi List,
I've been lurking here for over a week since I watched
David Blei's talk at Google.  I am interested in using
topic models to do feature engineering for music,
theatre, and other local events.
I'm looking to hire a consultant to help with
programming and model development this fall.
Ideal: someone that knows and loves C, topic
modeling and thinks setting up ACML-GPU with
a Radeon 4870x2 to run ctm on tens of thousands
of documents would be a fun two-day hack.
Two to three months full-time; telecommute is fine;
Boston, Hartford or Albany area is ideal.  It's NSF-
funded, so the work must be done in the U.S.
This list (as well as David Blei's documentation
and code) has already been very helpful; I'd love
to be able to spend our money in a way that helps
someone in this community.
I think off-list responses are most appropriate,
considering this sequence of symbols is non-
technical noise fouling up the clear signal that
normally flows from this message source.
Thanks,
