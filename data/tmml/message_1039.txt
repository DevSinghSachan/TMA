Not really beyond the introductory text there, no.  Depends on your
vocabulary size and on how many samples you want to use for the
particle filter and your ability and willingness to parallelize the
handling of those samples.  This code hasn't been used for many
problems so I have no general wisdom to offer about how many samples
you'll need.  There are some heuristics people use for particle
filters though.  And I never benchmarked directly against LDA-C since
my problem was too big for it and I didn't bother doing so with a
subset.
Best of luck and let me know how it goes.  Here's hoping a loose bit
doesn't fly off while you're working on it.
