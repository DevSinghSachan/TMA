hi nima
it may be too simple for your needs, but i've written an introduction to
topic modeling for the CACM.  i've pasted the abstract below my signature.
the full paper can be found here:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2011.pdf
this has not yet appeared in print.  if you (or anyone else) has feedback,
i'd be happy to receive it.
best
dave
