It turns out that we did the exact computation (rather than the
Gaussian approximation) to compute the free energy.  At convergence,
the Gaussian approximation is very accurate, but on the trajectory it
is not accurate all the way so the approximate free energy goes up and
down.  We computed the exact free energy using the convolution trick
as outlined in the appendix, which scales quadratically in the number
of data points.  This can be reduced to scaling linearly (but with a
large constant) by sparsifying the v_jk's by setting entries which are
very small to zero.
