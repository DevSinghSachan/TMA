Dear Friends:
I'm trying to obtain equation 5 in the paper "Finding scientific topics",
and I got a paper called "Gibbs sampling in the generative model of Latent
Dirichlet Allocation" written by the same author, which gives a more
detailed derivation. You can find the paper in:
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/613963.html
I have a question about equation 3 in that paper:
Shouldn't it be:
p(w_i|z_i=j,z_{-i},w_{-i}) = \int p(w_i|z_i=j,\phi^{(j)})
p(\phi^{(j)}|z_i=j,z_{-i},w_{-i})d\phi^{(j)}
The difference is in the right most term. I don't see why \phi^{(j)} is
independent of z_i=j given z_{-i} and w_{-i}.
"Finding scientific topics".
Please see the attachment for my derivation, if the attachment is somehow
filtered, please use the following latex source code
Regards
Jeffrey
