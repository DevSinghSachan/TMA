Quoting David Blei <blei at CS.Princeton.EDU>:
Anybody on this list doing this sort of thing with Twitter data? I saw
a few papers go by early in the year on Twitter topic models, but
nothing has showed up recently, which leads me to believe that it's
happening in non-academic non-open-source environments. ;-)
I ran a few preliminary Mallet topic models a couple of months ago on
Twitter data, but got thrown by Mallet's insistence on believing that
'http://meb.tw/aTWKnS' consists of four words, none of which are
English. ;-) The problem with that is that links, hashtags and
usernames - known as "entities" in Twitter - are "terms" in their own
right and should contribute to the definitions of topics. So I don't
want to do the obvious thing and strip them out with regular
expressions.
