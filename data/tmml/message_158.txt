Dear David,
Thank you very much for your answer.
Your equations make perfect sense indeed, and I have even verified
them from my experimental results.
Since your final equation gives an approximation to the original
matrix, I suppose that even if K (the number of topics) is equal to
the number of documents then there still won't be a perfect
reconstruction of the original matrix (in standard LSI if we keep all
the eigenvectors from the SVD decomposition we can get a perfect
reconstruction).
Best regards,
Nicholas
