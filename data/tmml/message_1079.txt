i didn't mean to be mysterious. ?it will be a NIPS paper, and the
camera-ready is due at the end of october. ?we will post it then.
i should add: based on the title, there looks to be another NIPS paper
about a similar problem. ?"Deterministic Single-Pass Algorithm for
LDA" by?I. Sato,?K. Kurihara,?H. Nakagawa?is also on the list of
accepted papers.
