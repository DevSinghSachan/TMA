Hi list,
I'm trying to evaluate a trained HDP for the heldout dataset. The HDP is in
direct assignment scheme(Teh 2005). To calculate the empirical
likelihood ,we need to sample n document according to HDP generating
process. I have two question about this process
1. How to tackle G_0(the top DP)? integrate out G_0 is not possible, I'm
thinking of estimated it by the mean : \beta_i=m_{. i}/m{..} (the number of
table assigned to ith class over the total number of table, all in Teh's
notation)
2. Does sampling new class allowed ? If so how to sample and use them in
the n sample documents. If not , we only consider the HDP as a finite
mixtures.
I've seen HDP empirical likelihood evaluation in Wei Li's Nonparametric
Bayes Pachinko Allocation . Anyone know how to calculate it ?
Thanks in advance
