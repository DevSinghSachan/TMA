Hi all,
I had built a multi-threaded extension of Prof. David Blei's LDA-C code more
than 3 years ago, and I recently used it on a corpus of half-a-million
documents with 150 topics on an 8 core machine with 24G memory, and it
finished in less than a day's time. I remember a discussion thread about
scalable implementations of LDA a while ago in this list, and I thought
people on this list might find this implementation useful. You may download
the code from https://sites.google.com/site/rameshnallapati/software. The
tar bundle contains a README file that contains usage instructions, that are
pretty much like Prof. Blei's LDA code except for an extra parameter that
lets you specify the number of threads to run.
I welcome any feedback, comments and suggestions on the implementation.
Thanks
-Ramesh
