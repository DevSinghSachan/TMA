corr-LDA code was included in it. However I downloaded the package and found
the files' postfix was rd,rds etc. Without googling what it is, I have to

accessing the code of corr-LDA.
As a new comer in LDA and not solid math background, some questions may
be very easy and really appreciating your answer.
