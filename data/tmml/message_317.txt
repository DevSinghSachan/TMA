Good afternoon.
I'm seeking a paper explaining the use of a straightforward DP prior for
LDA.  My primary purpose is to take a single step beyond LDA in explaining
the DP to students as part of a class covering topic modeling.  I have found
the following paper:

df
I'm wondering whether there are alternative papers worth considering as
well.
A possible next pedagogical step would be to explain hierarchical LDA, so I
want this DP-only step to be a smaller leap.
More generally, I'm interested in your experiences teaching topic models in
all of their variety.  In what order have you introduced the key concepts?
You are welcome to examine the schedule for my graduate course, if you're
curious how I'm approaching this:
