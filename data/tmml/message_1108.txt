Hi, folks,
I am curious that although there are numerous research work on Probabilistic Topic
Models, few researcher has given a clear definition of topic. The most often seen
interpretation is something like following.
topics are multinomial  distributions over words, and assume that each document can
be described as a mixture of these topics.
This explanation is quite vividly tell what the topic is for, but I am still feeling
it is lack of a clear definition.
So, what do you folks think?
Regards.
Charly
