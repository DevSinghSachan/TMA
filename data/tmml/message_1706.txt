CALL FOR PAPERS
======================================================================
The 4th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML2012)
Singapore, November 4-6, 2012

======================================================================
The 4th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML2012) will be held
on November 4-6, 2012, at the Singapore Management University,
Singapore. The conference aims at providing a leading international
forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share
their new ideas and achievements. Submissions from other than the
Asia-Pacific regions are also highly encouraged.
The conference program consist of tutorials, workshops, invited
keynote talks by distinguished researchers as well as single track
sessions of research paper presentations. The invited keynote speakers
for ACML 2012 are James Rehg (Georgia Tech), Dale Schuurmans
(University of Alberta), and Bob Williamson (Australian National
University and NICTA).
The proceedings will be published as a volume of Journal of Machine
Learning Research (JMLR): Workshop and Conference Proceedings. Authors
of selected papers will be invited to submit a significantly extended
version of their paper to a post-conference special issue of the
Machine Learning journal. The BEST STUDENT PAPER will receive an award
sponsored by the Machine Learning journal.
This year ACML will have a new feature: TWO submission deadlines. The
late deadline has the usual "accept" or "reject" outcomes. In addition
to the two outcomes, the early deadline also has "conditional accept
subject to required revisions", and "resubmit" with notification in
time for them to make the final deadline. The authors of a submission
with a "conditional accept" decision are strongly encouraged to
carefully address the review comments in their revision. The revision
without addressing the review comments properly might be rejected. The
submission of "resubmit" decision must be significantly improved and
revised before it can be re-submitted in the late deadline. Fresh
submissions that have not caught up with the early deadline are also
welcome for the late deadline.
