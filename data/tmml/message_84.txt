Hello Everyone,
I'd like to understand how to estimate hyper-parameters \alpha, \beta if I
use collapsed Gibbs sampler to do the LDA inference.
For the variational inference, step 1:  a lower bound of the marginal
distribution of a document p( \vec{w} | \alpha, \beta) is maximized to find
the optimized \gamma and \phi;  step 2:  then fix \gamma and \phi with the
optimized value, the same lower bound is maximized to find the optimized
\alpha and \beta. Is my understanding correct?
If I use Gibbs sampling for inference, I can plug in my estimation of the
real \theta and \phi values of the LDA model into the  lower bound, and in
step 2, do the same thing as in variational inference to find optimized
\alpha, \beta. Is that correct? Or is there any other way to do the
hyper-parameter estimation?
Thanks,
Sue
