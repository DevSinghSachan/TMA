Hi Azeem,
As Ramesh points out, it would help to be more specific about what you
expected to happen and what actually happened, but it sounds like
you want to infer labels for new documents. One thing to point out
is that there are two general classes of topic models that handle labeled
documents: conditional models and generative models. You can tell by
looking at the graphical structure. If the label appears in a node that
points to the topic distribution for the document ("upstream"), it's
conditional. The model is trying to learn how to predict topics *given*
labels. If the label appears in a node that can be reached from the topic
distribution ("downstream") the model is generative, and it is trying to
learn how to predict labels given topics. The author-topic model,
Dirichlet-multinomial regression, and Labeled LDA are general conditional
models, sLDA and DiscLDA are generative.
What's important is that if the model is conditionally trained, it's
possible to infer topics for unlabeled documents and then get a density
over labels, but there's no guarantee that the model will be good at that
task. For example, let's say your labels are ICML and NIPS. sLDA will try
to find topics that distinguish the two conferences, where DMR and labeled
LDA will say that they share almost all the same topics, which is true but
not useful for distinguishing them.
