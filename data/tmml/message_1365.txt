Hi Clint,
I am not an expert for short documents, but I guess having only few
terms might be problematic for topic models in general.
The smarts of topic models come from combinations of words that occur
across many documents. As documents get shorter, the informative word
combinations get less likely  and random combinations of (domain
specific) stop words take over.
You may also want to watch out for association chains that don't form a
topic as a whole, e.g., like ship - sea, sea - lake, lake - hike, hike -
shoes.
If you think of  informative word combinations are the "gasoline" of
standard LDA, the fancier models (HDP-LDA, etc) will need more gas.
Cheers,
Laura
