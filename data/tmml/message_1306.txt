Hi all,
Just a reminder that the deadline for paper submission for the Joint
Conference on Digital Libraries 2011 is coming up soon, Jan 23. The
full call for papers is here:

JCDL is a great venue for text mining, particularly work with a focus
on real applications and user needs. This year the conference will be
held in Ottawa.
