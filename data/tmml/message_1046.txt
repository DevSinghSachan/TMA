Edel,
There was some discussion of this paper in an earlier thread  - see
the archives for Jun 29.  It's not theoretically well-founded.
Essentially, they "hacked" LDA with the IDF weights.  Which I have to
admit is an intriguing idea to me - the idea of "hacking" an algorithm
as you would "hack" a piece of hardware, both of them being in some
sense "machines", but that's my overly analogizing brain in action.
You might be interested in another paper discussed in that thread, Joe
Reisinger's "Spherical Topic Models" paper
(www.icml2010.org/papers/45.pdf), which uses IDF weights by building
an LDA-like model around vMF distributions.
