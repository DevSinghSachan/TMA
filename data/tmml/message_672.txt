Hi, All
currently i'm trying to get the optimal number of topics from a test
dataset. In the paper from  Griffith, Steyvers about gibbs sampling they
present a solution by getting the Estimate P(w|T) from the posterior.
One should take the hamonic mean of the values from P(w|z).
1. Would one recommend this method?
2. Is there an easier calculation than the provided formula. Bayes Rule
