David,
I'm not sure if this question has already been answered, but there are
various heuristic initializations you can use to avoid the "thick
branch" phenomenon in hLDA (assuming its not due to the hyperparameter
setting). The most basic one is to build the tree incrementally, where
each time you add a document you compute its conditional path
assignment distribution from the previously added documents. This is
basically just the same as the c_m update step, except you don't
remove document m from the tree first. For me though, this still
tended to bias towards trees with a single thick branch, so I opted
for a heuristic initialization where x% of the documents generate
entirely new branches and the the remaining 100-x% are assigned to
some existing branch uniformly. This works nicely for the flat hLDA,
but I haven't tried it in the GEM version.
Anyway I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts on these
initialization heuristics.
Btw I have a vanilla PAM implementation using HBC, its not thoroughly
tested, but email me if you're interested.
