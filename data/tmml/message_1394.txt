Hi Scott,
? In addition to Chomp, which is doing really cool things, Jstor's
research group is also using topic models for search.? Specifically,
the discipline browser and their Data for Research Website use topics
to restrict search results to certain categories (see
http://dfr.jstor.org).? Google has used topic models for summarizing
the content of documents, and researchers at Yahoo have studied LDA
for matching items (webpages or ads) with users.  (search fLDA by
Agarwal and Chen).
ETS has studied topic models for automated essay grading (see
"Comparison of Dimension Reduction Methods for Automated Essay
Grading"), and Pearson is working on the same sorts of technology (see
http://www.pearsonkt.com/ ) using topic models.  IMHO, it's slightly
scary that students' essays might be graded by algorithms with the
current limitations we have in NLP.
Cheers,
Sean
