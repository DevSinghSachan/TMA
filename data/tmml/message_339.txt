hi kevin,
typically, asserts don't indicate problems.  they are used to find and
diagnose them.  if the likelihood ever is NaN then i want the program
to stop running because there is something seriously wrong.
i'm not sure what your problem might be, but the likelihood should not
be NaN.
best,
dave
