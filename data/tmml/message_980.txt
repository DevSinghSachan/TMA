Wouldn't it be possible to put something like HBC on top of FACTORIE,
as a kind of higher-level interface which would compile the user's
distribution definitions into the appropriate Scala code?  If the user
wanted to do something beyond the capabilities of this high-level
interface, he'd just drop down to the regular Scala level.
