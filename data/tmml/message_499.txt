Thanks, David.
If I were to try clustering with n-gram features, I would start by looking
to Wang & McCallum's work on Topical N-grams for inspiration.  Probably
worth pursuing.
There is some fairly recent work on using the vMF in place of the
multinomial for clustering, which I recently learned about through Charles
Elkan's work:
Zhong, S. & Ghosh, J. (2005). Generative model-based document
clustering: a comparative study. Knowledge and Information Systems, 8(3),
374?384.
Elkan and others have followed up using the vMF and the Dirichlet Compound
Multinomial:
Elkan, C. (2006). Clustering documents with an exponential-family
approximation of the Dirichlet compound multinomial distribution. In ICML
?06: Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine learning.
New York, NY: ACM, 289?296.
