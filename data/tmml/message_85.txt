hi topic models list,
just a reminder for those at NIPS: we're meeting tonight for dinner
at 6pm.  we're meeting in kirin restaurant at 102-1166 alberni
street, which is on alberni between thurlow and bute.
no one really knows how many are coming so i made reservations for 25
people for 6pm (3 tables, under dave).  chances are we won't be that
many, but in case we are they'll be able to accommodate us.
looking forward!
best,
dave
