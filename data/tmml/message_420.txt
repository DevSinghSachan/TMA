Hi Gregg,
LDA is an dimensionality reduction on its own, so I am not sure about
the benefits from combinations with yet another dim reduction. I would
guess that you will not gain much by stemming, too. Both issues have
already been discussed on this list and you find them in the archive.
In order to speed things up, I would go for a different approach. Words
that occur only in a single document do not contribute to the problem in
an LDA sense and can be removed from the data. You could reduce the
number of words by increasing a threshold X in "a word must occur in at
least X different documents to be considered". Note that it is slightly
different from "a word must occur at least Y times in the corpus".
I have not tried something like this. It was just an idea one might play
with. (@list, if this is not a good idea in general, I would like to
know...)
Cheers,
Laura
