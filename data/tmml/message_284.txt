Hi all,
I am interested in applying LDA for collaborative filtering.
This means that given a movie dataset (which corresponds to the corpus
of documents), I want to obtain, for each topic, the probability of a
particular rating for each movie. This is a bit different then in the
case of documents, because \beta in each topic, is not just a vector
with probabilities of occurrences of words (like for documents), but a
2-dim table (number_movies X number_rates).
I did not understand exactly the way how LDA for documents, especially
the C-code of LDA for topic modeling, can  be applied for collaborative
filtering (Section 7.3 from LDA Blei, Ng, Jordan). And how can you
obtain \beta_movies (an entry in \beta_movies corresponds to the
probability of a rating for a movie) in this case?
Thanks in advance,
Adriana
