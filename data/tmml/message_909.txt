Dave Blei, Jerry Zhu, and I had a paper about using WordNet to give a
prior for the distributions over topics.  It distinguished the senses
of words (thus allowing WSD in a topic model setting) in the
generative process but still used the same unannotated documents as
input.  We did not evaluate on perplexity, and I don't have a good
intuition of how that would pan out.
