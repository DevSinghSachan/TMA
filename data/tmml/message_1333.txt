Hi everyone,
If we have already learned a topic model, how can we know the topic
distribution for the whole corpus?
By the way, if we have new data, can we estimate a new model based on
the parameters estimated by an old model as the topic prior and does
the topics in the newly learned mode the same with the old model
(assume that the data have the same vocabulary as feature space and the
number of topics are the same)?
Regards,
Peng
