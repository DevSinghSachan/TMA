hi all,
(apologies for the long delay in answering these questions.)
i hope i can clear up this confusion.  it is completely the fault of
the authors.  the write-up has some errors.
the goal is to sample the level assignment for a particular word.  the
path through the infinite depth tree is fixed, as are all the other
level assignments.
this distribution is in equation 2.  the problem is that there are an
infinite number of values of z.  we sample in stages.
first, we sample from the distribution where z can take on one of the
values in {1, 2, ..., max, > max).  these are each level up to the
maximum level at which words are assigned, and a slot for a level
greater than max.  for levels up to max, we can use the unnumbered
equation following eq 2 (for the "prior" of z) and the numbered
equation 3 (for the "likelihood" of w given z).
(the first mistake in this section is that max is not the maximum
level for a document, but rather the maximum level at which words are
assigned in *any* document.)
next, we need to compute the probability that z > max, bringing us to
the second mistake in the section: the unnumbered equation following
eq 3 is wrong.  the probability is proportional to
p(z > max | w) \propto p(z > max) p(w | z > max)
the first term p(z > max) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{max} p(z = i).  the second
term p(w | z > max) is actually easy.  by the definition above, no
words have been assigned to topics for any z > max.  so, using eq. 3,
we see that p(w | z > max) = 1/V.
i hope this clears things up.  i will fix them in the next revision of
the paper.
best,
dave
