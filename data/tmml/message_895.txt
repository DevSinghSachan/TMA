dear jake,
first, it is necessary for considering infinite length trees.
second, in practice, it helps encourage higher level topics to be more
"abstract."  otherwise, the posterior has the flexibility to associate
a higher level topic with (non-abstract) words from a document, and to
simply not associate other documents with that topic.  (i've seen this
happen.)  you are right that perhaps higher posterior probability is
obtained with the "right" decomposition, but the sampler is easily
stuck in a variety of local minima.
