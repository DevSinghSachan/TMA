Hi list,
I'm puzzled when reading Wei's paper: Nonparametric Pachinko Allocation.
1. How to calculate the likelihood of an observation(word) assigned to a
category(supertopic)?
The paper doesn't give explicit formula for the category likelihood.Since a
supertopic is a Dirichlet distribution over subtopic.the likelhood should
in the form of Dirichlet Multinomial Distribution(aka polya distribution):
p(z|
\alpha)=\frac{\Gamma(\sum_{k}\alpha_{k})}{\Gamma(\sum_{k}n_{k}+\alpha_{k})}\prod\frac{\Gamma(n_{k}+\alpha_{k})}{\Gamma(\alpha_{k})}
where z is the subtopic assignment of a document, n_k is the number of
times the outcome in z was k.
But how to calculate alpha,through parameter estimation like in PAM or
through the \beta variable in categroy DP(see Teh's HDP)?
2. How to adjust the subtopic menu(m variable in the paper) after a
successful reassignment of observation category?
When the observation category(supertopic) is changed, the subtopic menu
assignment is invalid since menus differs throughout the categories.How to
adjust it,simply resample a menu in the new category?What about the menus
in the original category ,do we need update the menu statistics and remove
some menu if necessary?
Also from my experience on the barexample in the paper, i feel the
Dirichlet distribution is bad at modelling correlation(especially those
small \alpha). I discover a lot of "splitted" supertopics in my
experiment(over 2 times of the "true" supertopic). Do you guys has similar
findings?
thanks in advance
