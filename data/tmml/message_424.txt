Hi Gregg and everyone,

Results with a Gibbs sampler: Java vs. Java with JNI C saved 40% time
(on the well-known NIPS data set). Pure native C is marginally faster.
As an alternative to computing clusters, a $200 graphics adapter might
be a solution, too. We've got some promising results parallelising lda-c
on a G80 GPU using the CUDA API. Hope we can open the code soon.
