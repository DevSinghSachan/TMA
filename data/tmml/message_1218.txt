Hi,
I'm still striving to dig the LDA code, but not able to figure out how to
solve the puzzle I have so far. To be more specific, I'm working on problem
where I need to predict the presence of a word in a given document. Even if
my document doesn't have that specific word in it, I want to have a
probability for that word to happen in my document. Hence, I'll be able to
draw a conclusion, but I need to learn more.
Does anyone have an idea how I can get this information from the code or the
output files?
Thank you for your help.
Halil
