Hi
It seems that it is typical for people to use a symmetric
hyperparameter for the word-topic prior in smoothed LDA models (that
is, a symmetric value for \eta in the terminology of Blei, Ng, Jordan
(2003)) (this is done in Griffiths, Steyvers (2009)).
But, the i-th component of Dir(x,\eta) gives the likelihood that the
probability of event i is x_i after having observed it \eta_i-1 times.
So, it seems to me that one would have to choose something like
\eta_t = n_t  + 1, where n_t is the total number of times term t was
observed in the corpus.  Have I misunderstood something about this?
Thanks,
Jonathan Halcrow
