Sorry, I didn't ask clearly.
What I mean is that most bigrams have only one topic, for example, AB only
goes to topic 8, CD only goes to topic 10. I thought one bigram might be in
different topics, for example, the count of (AB, topic 8) > 0, and (AB,
topic 40) >0.
Maybe it's because bigrams have more determined semantics than unigrams?
