David Blei writes about the 'specificity' of a topic word (to a document
set) in his paper Introduction to Probabilistic Topic Models
(http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2011.pdf). In particular,
Figure 3 in the paper plots word 'frequency' against word 'specificity'
for a Yale Law Journal data set.
Unfortunately, he does not state what he is using as a measure of
'specificity'. From my (limited) experience with LDA, the weight of
words is a logarithmic relation to the word counts which would preclude
it being used as a measure of 'specificity'.
Could it be he is using TF/IDF (Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency)?
Most grateful for any insight.
