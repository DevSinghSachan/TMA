Hi all,
<shamelessplug>
I've just released version 1.1 of my LDA package for R.  It uses a
collapsed gibbs sampler to implement many models including LDA, sLDA, MMSB,
RTM, NUBBI.  I'm hoping the community will find this useful and let me know
how I can further improve it.
There are some pretty pictures on my blog that demonstrate the ease with
which one can do lots of analyses using the package in conjunction with
ggplot2:

And it's on CRAN so you can just install it by running
install.packages("lda").

Cheers,
Jonathan
