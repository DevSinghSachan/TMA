Hi Anthony and list,
thanks, this looks very much like what I've been looking for!

I understand the last step to be :
p( z_i=k | z_{i,-m}, w_i=t )
\propto (n_{k,t,-m} + \eta) (n_{m,k,-m} + \alpha)
\propto n_{k,t,-m} + \eta ,
where z_{-m} is the topic vector excluding the current document and thus
the second term can be omitted because all observations of the new
document were excluded. This means that p( z_i = k_new | z_{i,-m}, w_i=t
) \propto \eta , i.e., ``lives'' by just the smoothing influence, right?
Is there citable literature on such blocked Gibbs draws ?
Cheers,
