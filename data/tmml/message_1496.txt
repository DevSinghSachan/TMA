Hello,
no the window would be 1...n (my setting is 10)
The weighted beta distribution is averaged to the whole window size if
the n'th chunk arrived. So until this state there would be a high
dissimilarity between chunks. This effect gets smaller until the window
size is reached and stabilizes then.
All the best
