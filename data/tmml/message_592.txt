I would like to get pointers to papers/references/tech reports, that address
comparison of various language models for IR purposes
The comparison is in terms of
Training - Time and Space
Storage - To store parameters
Inference - for an unseen document - Time and Space
Scalability - Time taken for incremental update
I thank everyone in advance for your help.
