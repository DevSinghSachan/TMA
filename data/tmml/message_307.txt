hi laura,
if i understand correctly, you find K=137 for 60 documents.  this
means that there are more than two components per document.  at most,
the model should only use 60 components.  with an HDP, it should
require fewer since each document exhibits multiple components.
it's hard to know what's wrong, but one thing to try is to interleave
hyper-parameter updates after many HDP updates of the z's.  perhaps
the initial condition sends your sampler into a strange space.
best,
dave
