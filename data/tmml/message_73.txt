Hello Everyone,
I'd like to understand how to move from a single value
hyper-parameter \alpha (\beta) to a vector-valued \Alpha (\Beta) for the
topic model Gibbs sampler. All the references I found so far construct the
sampler based on a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with single
hyper-parameters ( e.g refer to equation 2 in "Newman, Smyth, and Steyvers
(2006). Scalable Parallel Topic Models. In *JICRD*" or the LDA saurce code)
- How would the posterior estimate of the token's topic ( p(z_i =j
|z_{-i},w_i,d_i,.) ) be computed if we have a vector of hyper-parameters
\Alpha? Does it just involve substituting \Alpha_{j} & \Beta_{i} instead of
\alpha & \beta, respectively, or it is more complicated?
- How about the "W*\beta" in the denominator..
I'd really appreciate the help as I lack the statistical experience to
figure it out myself.
Cheers,
