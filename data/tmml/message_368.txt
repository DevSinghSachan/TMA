Hi all,
I understand that CORR-LDA can be used for modeling a corpus of images where
each image is being represented by 2 entities (*r,w*). Now suppose I have
one more entity to represent the images so that I have 3 pieces of
information. Can the same model be extended to this case?
Is there any such work reported?
regards
veena
