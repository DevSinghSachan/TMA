Do the hyperparameters differ in this respect from the topics themselves?
They are all latent variables, and hence, they depend strongly on the
structure of the model.  Do you think, David, that the hyperparameters are
somehow *more* dependent?  I would guess that they are actually less
dependent, since they are of much lower dimensionality than the topic
models.
Of course referring to these as "topics" is already dubious.  I don't see
why learning the hyperparameters makes that any less appropriate.
