Hi  ? ?,
Regarding the evolution of topics, did you check out these papers?
T. L. Griffiths & M. Steyvers (2004). `Mapping Knowledge Domains:
Finding scientific topics'. Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) 101(1):5228-5235.
X. Wang & A. McCallum (2006). `Topics over time: a non-Markov
continuous-time model of topical trends'. In Proceedings of the 12th ACM
SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,
KDD '06, pp. 424-433, New York, NY, USA. ACM.
S. Gerrish & D. Blei (2010). `A Language-based Approach to Measuring
Scholarly Impact'. In ICML '10: Proceedings of the 27th International
Conference on Machine Learning.
As you mentioned sentiments, maybe this paper gives you an idea:
I. Titov & R. Mcdonald (2008). `A Joint Model of Text and Aspect Ratings
for Sentiment Summarization'. In Proceedings of ACL-08: HLT, pp. 308-316.
Cheers,
Laura
P.S. Let's hope that the revolution of topics does not turn into a
rebellion of the topics :)
