Gammas are the parameters of the variational posterior distribution, which
is a Dirichlet distribution, hence they can be greater than 1. The
normalized values of gammas will give you the expected value of \thetas with
respect to the posterior, so you could probably normalize them to get
expected distribution over topics for each document.
