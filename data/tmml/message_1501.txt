Dear Li Quingshan,
I am not sure whether I understood your concern right. There are two
concepts that are referred to with the term likelihood.
a) The training (or test,holdout,...) likelihood of a corpus. This
describes the quality of the inferred parameters and model.
b) The likelihood of a topic given a document, where we actually mean
the probability of a topic given a document.
I got the impression that Alexandre, Heinrich, and ap.dat are talking
about a) but your question refers to b). Is that right?
When you say likelihood of topic in a document, do you refer to the
topic with the highest proportion in the document's topic mixture theta?
So you want to choose the topic_d := argmax_t theta_d(t)?
Lets call topic_d the topic that dominates the document. You can use it
as a rough approximation if you want to find a hard cluster
(partitioning) of documents.
But the LDA model is much richer than this, as a document may have more
than one dominating topics. Even words may have more than one dominating
topic.
Cheers,
Laura
