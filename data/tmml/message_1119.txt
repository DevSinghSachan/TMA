Hi David,
Thanks for the clarification.
I was thinking about the standard perplexity measurement from page 1008 of
Blei's LDA paper.

but this could be controlled using the convergence criteria for variational
EM.  I mean  if you are obtained increased values of perplexity calculated
as:
perp = exp ( (-1) * (sum_likelihoods / vocab_size)))
