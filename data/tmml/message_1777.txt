Hi Rahul,
I've implemented both a variational and a Gibbs Sampling version of the
User Rating Profile model.
For the comparison and implementation you can take a look to this paper
http://unical.academia.edu/NicolaBarbieri/Papers/803076/Regularized_Gibbs_Sampling_for_User_Profiling_with_Soft_Constraints
I can provide some source code if needed...
