I'm using HEAD off the repo right now (updated/recompiled today), and when I
try to run a standard LDA topic model, its stopping after 300 iterations
despite my request for more.  No error message, it just stops.  I know it
doesn't think this is the max because it doesn't output state.gz, only
state.{0,50,100,150,200,250,300}.gz.  I'm using 1-thread with 100 iterations
of hyperparameter optimization.
Anyone have a similar experience?
Unrelated, n-grams is complaining it can't serialize its own class to output
the model.  I suspect PAM will have the same problem since it too doesn't
implement serialization.
