In addition, I would like to add my joint work with Prof. William Cohen and
Prof. John Lafferty that models evolution of topics at multiple resolutions
of time scale, which was one of the best paper finalists at KDD 2007, titled
"Multiscale Topic
Tomography<http://sites.google.com/site/nmramesh77/research-papers/2007_kdd.pdf?attredirects=0>".
The source code is also available at
http://sites.google.com/site/rameshnallapati/software but is not well
documented yet.
Thanks
