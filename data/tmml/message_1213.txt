Hello LDA experts,
I am just starting to play with LDA -- Blei's C version. :)
I have the following error msg.
number of docs??? : 1506560
number of terms?? : 11865685
Segmentation fault
Would you advise me if there is a limit in terms of the number of documents and/or the number of terms?
FYI, the command line is
$> lda est 0.2 500 ./inf-settings.txt myData.txt? random .
Thank you so much in advance.
