Hi,
You are right that in prediction y_d is typically unobserved.  But
conveniently, y_d is a leaf node of the sLDA graphical model and hence can be
dropped from the inference step.   So to do predictions you can just run the
standard LDA inference scheme (with the topics learned at train time), and
then regress on the expected value of z_bar.
Cheers,
Jonathan
