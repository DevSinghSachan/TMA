I can think of two quick/easy ways to make the topics consistent across two
corpora:
(i) Train an LDA model on the union of the two corpora, and
(ii) Train the model on one, and perform inference using the trained model
on the other. You can do this with David Blei's LDA-C code.
Using the parameters from one corpus as a prior on the other corpus is a
good idea that may keep the models close together, but may not guarantee
absolute consistency.
For a more sophisticated and elegant solution, you may also want to refer to
Chong Wang's paper on Markov Topic
Models<http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chongw/papers/WangThiessonMeekBlei2009.pdf>
that
models the correlations between topics across multiple corpora.
