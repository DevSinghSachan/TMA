hi min
i haven't had that problem.  (i run the CTM program on my mac.)
someone else has also mentioned it, but i wasn't able to recreate his
issue on my computer.  using his data, the models were fit without a
problem.
i have CC'ed the topic models mailing list (which i suggest you
subscribe to) to see if anyone else has noticed this issue.
best,
dave
