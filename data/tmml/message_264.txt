Hi,
I am also trying to implement hLDA but I have not finished yet.
Actually, I am not quite sure about the initialization of the path
assignments that actually give the form of the tree at the end. What I am
saying is that I am not sure if you have to follow a specific
initialization. However, the paper says that the number of leaves is the
union of existing paths and number of internal nodes. So, I guess you can
initialize the tree this way.
Cheers,
ilias.
