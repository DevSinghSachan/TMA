Hi List,
I am back with more questions :)
I have been wondering, is the stick breaking prior really necessary?
Since the documents are already sharing nodes at the top of the tree,
do we still need to add more statistical pressure to force the words
to be near the top. I am just wondering whether anyone have tried.
