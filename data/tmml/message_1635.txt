Hello,
I've fit a correlated topic model and I'd like to inspect the
resulting covariance matrix between topics. How can I reconstruct the
K by K covariance matrix given the K-1 by K-1 matrix in final-cov.dat?
I noticed that the lasso-graph.r script attached does something
completely different and ignores the covariance matrix while using the
l1-regularized regression to predict topics given topic, to get nice
binary edges in a graph, but I'd like to inspect the actual learned
matrix.
Any idea how to do this?
