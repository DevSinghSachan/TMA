This confuses me as well, but it is the point of the list serve from what I
understand, the issue of inducing the alpha using sampling, is for the case
in which the priors are not discrete counts, ie rather sampling a dice
manufacturer to see if it is fair, where you proceed by counting the
outcomes of rolls from different dice, you are sampling a ruler manufacturer
to see how precise the subdivisions of the ruler are, indeed there is a mean
ratio, but the "precision" is the quantity which you are interested.  This
can be obtained via an optimization algorithm, whereas the optimization is
unnecessary in the discrete case.
Please do correct me...
