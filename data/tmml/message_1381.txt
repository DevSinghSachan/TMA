hi zy vxd (sorry, can't read mandarin) -- the derivation starts by observing
that the parts of (73) correspond to the two quotients in (74) on the right.
In footnote 20, it is stated that p(w) is omitted in the denominator. Note that
then we have to put a proportional-to sign instead of equality.
In (74), insert the terms terms of (73) into the corresponding parts of (74).
This leaves us with the two quotients in (75) because only those terms are left
that have token i excluded in the denominator in (74) right. Note that this
corresponds to term w_i = t and current topic association z_i, which are both
known at the time of sampling.
Continuing from (75), you expand the multidimensional beta function, Delta(.),
and will see that again all terms cancel except the ones given in (76).
Ok?
best regards
