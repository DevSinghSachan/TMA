Hello Donn,
thanks for your quick reply and the patch!
It seems the patch is no executable, so I consider it to be guideline
for the changes which I ought to apply to the original source files, is
that right!?
One more question. As far as I know, C/C++ often use pointer
arithmetics, i.e. data from the memory is accessed by locating a
starting address and using the byte-size of the variables to read out
consecutive blocks from the memory to access arrays or matrices. Are you
confident that the modifications do not interfer on that level? Or in
other words, does the modified code work well for you?
Best regards,
Sebastian
