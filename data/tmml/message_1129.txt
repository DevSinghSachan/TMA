There was a paper presented at SIGKDD 2010 that used a modified HDP to model
a a set of varying corpora that used a shared global measure for all times.
That paper is by Jianwen Zhang et al and is called "Evolutionary
Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes for Multiple Correlated Time-varying
Corpora".  It is similar to an HDP with 3 levels, but the DP draws depend on
the previous days draws as well as their parents.
