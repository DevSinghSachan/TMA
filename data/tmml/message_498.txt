Eric,
Thanks for this paper; I got a good insight out of it re the
stochastic nature of Gibbs sampling vs. EM.   I wonder how embedding a
bigram or higher instead of a unigram for the P(w|z) would fare.  That
ought to be easy to do, since you're assigning the topic to the entire
document.
Also related to document clustering, there's an interesting-looking
paper in the NIPS topic workshop this year that models topics with vMF
distributions, rather than multinomials.
