Dear All,
I am using topic models for image categorization problems in which an image
is represented as a bag of "visual words". For my problem, the number of
"words" contained in each image varies greatly. This is equivalent to
document modeling where the length of documents varies. My questions is: do
I need to do some normalization before applying topic models? If yes, then
the normalized document-term frequency may not even be an integer and I am
not sure if this still makes sense for topic models?
Thank you,
Shuiwang
