indeed, the prior on the topics affects their sparsity.  if your
model prefers sparser topics, then you'll end up with more of them in
the posterior to explain the data.
one option is to try empirical bayes estimates of that parameter.
that is, you could use MCEM or variational EM to fit it.
as aaron said, in some cases you can simply set it to induce the kind
of topics that you are after.  depending on your goals, you can set
the sparsity parameter to induce fewer diffuse topics or more sparse
topics.
as a third alternative, if you are using the model for some kind of
prediction or other measurable task, then you can set it by cross
validation.
