Yes, even I am facing the sam eproblem. Say when I have some K number of
\phi values, according to theory they should add upto one. They are no doubt
addiing upto one. However, as you said, only one of the K values are
becoming one and rest all are zero. Even I am worried with this problem.
Anyone else has an answer for this?
