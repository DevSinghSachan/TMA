Hi Ayan,
Yes, you are right that sLDA can show weaker fit to data as well as
poorer topic quality. This happens particularly when the content word
representation do not really indicate the reason for the value of the
response variable for e.g. bag-of-words in product reviews will throw
off sLDA performance. This, though, is not a fault of sLDA. If the goal
is to find better topics in presence of document discriminating labels,
one can use the method used in "clustering the Tagged Web" by Daniel
Ramage et. al. One can create document discriminating labels by using
some supervised framework prior to topic modeling.
