Hi, Gregor and All others,
I'm now trying to follow the work on estimating hyper-parameter of
LDA. As a beginner of LDA, I have read the turtorial "Parameter
estimation for text analysis"
written by Gregor Heinrich, and got some questions on it, following
are these questions:
1. Have anyone ever tried to using sampling method to estimate the
hyper-parameters? Why not estimate asymmetric prior instead symmetric
one, since asymmetric
sounds more reasonable.
2. Gregor has mentioned two sampling methods, adaptive rejection
Metropolis sampling and adaptive rejection method, as we know that the
latter one can skip the
computationally expensive Metropolis step but with the limitation of
requirement of (log f)'' <0 (log concave density), however, I cannot
prove that the p(/alpha| z) in
LDA is a log concave density. Does anyone ever give a prove of that?
If it cannot be proved, is it means that this sampling work cannot be
achieved by adaptive
rejection sampling?
3.In the section 6.3, Efficient estimation, Gregor talks about using
results of Mink00, and said that the result cannot be used to estimate
/beta, because of it on the condition
of {M, E{N}}>20K, but I really cannot find where does this condition
come from Mink's paper, and also I cannot figure out why /alpha meets
this condition? Did I miss something?
4.There're quite a few method in Mink's paper, why not use other's
such as Newton-Raphson which don't have condition limitation
aforementioned?
anyone got any idea about any of these questions, please help me to
figure it out, thank you very much!
Best,
Feng
