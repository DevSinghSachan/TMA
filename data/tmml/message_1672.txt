Topic Modelers,
I am considering the problem of document retrieval. My intuition is
that a simple retrieval model, such as the vector space model (VSM),
will have higher precision but lower recall, when compared to the
fully-generative LDA model. VSM is more restrictive and gives fewer
"hits", but the hits that it does give have high confidence (i.e.,
exact-word match). On the other hand, LDA is more inclusive and can
associate more terms (e.g., "car" with "automobile"), leading to
higher recall but not quite the precision.
Is there any work that confirms or disputes this intiution (i.e., that
VSM has higher precision but lower recall vs. LDA), either
theoretically or empirically?
