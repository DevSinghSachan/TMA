Hi Eva,
Thanks for writing. The answers to your questions are:
1. This is one possibility, but it's more common in practice to use
E[beta] instead of e^{E[log beta]}. You can get E[beta] by normalizing
the rows of lambda so that they sum to 1.
2. Likewise, it's more common to use E[theta] instead of e^{E[log
theta]}. As in (1), you can get this by normalizing the rows of gamma
so that they sum to 1.
Gamma and lambda are free variational parameters, and lambda can be
interpreted as the "output" of the algorithm insofar as any quantity
of interest about the variational posterior over beta can be computed
given lambda. Sorry for any confusion arising from referring to lambda
as "the topics," it would be more correct (but much more awkward) to
write "the free parameters lambda controlling the variational
distribution q(beta)" everywhere.
Hope that helps!
Best,
Matt
