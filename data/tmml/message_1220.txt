Hi,
I think the fundamental differences are clear but, however, it doesn't
directly imply the performance loss/gain in prediction tasks.
It strongly depends on the corpus, hence I suggest to run tests on your data.
I suspect RTextTools.com is a good starting point for generating this
comparison
( with many other methods too ) in a unified framework.
