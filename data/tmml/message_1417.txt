I think variational inference (VI) is derived from variational
calculus (VC). In VI, the only assumption is
a factorized distribution over hidden variables. There is no
restriction on the functions of the factors.
So optimization requires a search through the space of functions,
which requires VC.
However, it can be derived that the optimal function with respect to
each factor can be obtained by
minimizing the KL divergence, which makes the search process simple.
The optimal function turns out to be the
expectation(over all other factors) of the complete data log-likelihood.
