Hi, folks,
I am new for this group and the LDA topic model. We plan to use LDA as an
dimension reduction tool for similarity computation.
I had read related paper by Blei, but I found it was still difficult for a
newbie to overcome the details. And I have a specific problem right now.
We had gotten the *.gamma file by lda-c inference mode, and we know it is
the variational Dirichlet parameters for each document;
But in order to compute the Hellinger distance, we need to know the exact
topic proportions by their possibilities.
So my question is how can I get the exact possibilities of each topic for a
document? (I am using lda-c)
Any clues or comments for solving this problem are welcomed.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Mingli
