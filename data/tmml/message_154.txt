hi antonio,
the beta file contains the learned topics.  each row is the log of
the distribution over terms.  (if you exponentiate each term and
compute the sums of the rows, you will see that they sum to one.)
the gamma file are the (approximate) posterior dirichlet parameters
for the topic proportions of each document.
i hope this helps.  good luck!
best,
dave
