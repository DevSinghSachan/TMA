dear anja
at the time of publication, we weren't legally allowed to distribute
the data.  however, JSTOR has recognized its value to the academic
community.  they have created the "data for research" site for
distributing word counts.  see
http://dfr.jstor.org/
in the top left is a menu called "data requests."
