I have not yet used MALLET before. One thing I wanted to clarify is that I
am not concerned implementing LDA only but some other generative models
which are related to LDA to some extent. Are the packages in MALLET flexible
enough so that I can instantly make some new model by using/modifying some
existing codes?
Thanks,
