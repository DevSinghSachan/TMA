The man at the head of that group is John Wilbur (
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Wilbur/ ), a representative
paper of his on the subject of building topics, or as he calls them
themes, is Hagit Shatkay, W. John Wilbur: Finding Themes in Medline
Documents: Probabilistic Similarity Search. ADL 2000: 183-192 but it
is an EM algorithm described there.  I think what I'm remembering is
in his "A theory of information with special application to search
problems," Wilbur W.J.; Neuwald A.F., Computers and Chemistry, Volume
24, Number 1, January 2000 , pp. 33-42(10) but I've lost access to
that so I'll have to dig around a bit more for it to be sure.
