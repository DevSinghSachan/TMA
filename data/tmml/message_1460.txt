Hi Scrlett,
I donot think that the source code for CORR-LDA is available.  However, the
C code for LDA can be easily adapted to CORR-LDA which involves plugging in
additional parameter estimation equations. That is easy to do.
Only thing is that you have to complete the derivation of the update
equations which is not available in the paper.
