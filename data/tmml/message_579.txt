Hi all:
Thanks for your detailed reply to my previous questions.
Recently, I am reading the paper "evaluation methods for Topic models".
Because of my poor English and basic skills there are some parts that I cannot
understand:
what's the rule of the transition operator T ? Is it the same in AIS and
Chib-style estimation, can T(z^(s)<-z^(s-1)) for each s be computed from equation
(24)?
One step further, how to compute the equation(19)? Since z^'is not known.
How to compute P_s(z)? Can we compute it by the equation (3)in the paper of
Giffs 2004"Finding scientific topics"?
Anthor question is about the gamma function in C++, its value often
overflow(even after log ),for example if I compute log( gamma(1000)) it will
returns 1.#INF00, have you ever encountered such problem and what's your solution
Thanks for your attention and best regards!
Wan shi ru yi!
