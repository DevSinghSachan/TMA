I can see final.gamma file after learning parameter alpha and beta.
I guess that this file is a p(z|theta_d)  , where z is a sub-topic
and theta_d is a topic of document d.
What mathematical procedure is hidden behind this file?
I think inference step seems similar. But after inference step we can only
get p(z,theta) joint probability matrix.
Isn't it little different? Do anyone knows?
please answer me~
Regards.
