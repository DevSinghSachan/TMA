Estimating the likelihoods in LDA is a challenging problem.
Several methods have been proposed to estimate test set perplexity.
The following break-through paper by Wallach et al in ICML 2009 lists some:
"Evaluation Methods for Topic Models" Hanna Wallach, Iain Murray,
Ruslan Salakhutdinov and David Mimno. ICML, 2009, Montreal, Quebec.
In my ACML'09 paper, I corrected two of their methods and proved
one was unbiased.   See "Estimating Likelihoods for Topic Models,"

Note I also did *exact* likelihood calculations in some cases, in order to
really test things out.  The two methods that work well are:
Mean Field Approximation for Importance Sampling  (much faster)
Left-to-Right Sequential Sampler
(provably unbiased)
