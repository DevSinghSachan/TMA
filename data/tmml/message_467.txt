Dear all,
I am wondering about the independence assumption of documents in corpus
described in the document ?Parameter estimation for text analysis? [Gregor
Heinrich] which is very good document about LDA with Gibbs sampling.
The generative model of LDA here was described a bit different from the
original paper of [Blei, 2003] in which the multinominal probability (a k*V
matrix \phi in this document) is drawn from a Dir(\beta). Note that \beta
here is a hyper parameter, not a k*V matrix like in the original paper.
The equation (60) of probability of a corpus in the document of Heinrich is
given:
P(corpus|\alpha,\beta) = Product of p(document_i|\alpha,\beta)
This is what makes me confused about the proper of this equation. Should the
documents in the corpus be independent given \phi (k*V matrix, corresponding
to \beta in the original paper) or not???
Thank you,
Nguyen Cam Tu
