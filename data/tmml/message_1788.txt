Hi there,
I got some problems when read the paper On-Line LDA: Adaptive Topic Models
for Mining Text Streams with Applications to Topic Detection and Tracking
[1] by AlSumait, L
1) what's the content of the beta(k,t)? i think the size of this matrix is
KxV (K is the number of the topics and the V is the number of the unique
words in the corpus), right?
but i'm not quite sure what is the element of this matrix? in the paper it
mentioned "So, the count of words in topics, resulted from running LDA on
documents received at time t, can be used as the priors for the t + 1
stream." from this line, i would say the element is the times of word (t)
show up in the topic (k), but in the algorithm 1, it also mentioned that
"Bt =Bt1??t,k?{1,???,K}" while the ?t is a multinomial distribution, how to
join them? (thinking of one is a count while another is distribution)
2) in the paper it mentioned "An emerging topic can be viewed as the one
that is different from its peers in the same stream..."
i'm not quite sure what's "peer" mean here, does it mean the other topics
(i.e. different topic index respect to the K)  or the topic with the same
topic index in previous time window?
P.S. i have send this mail to the author of this paper but haven't got any
response, so i post it here.
Regards & Thanks,
