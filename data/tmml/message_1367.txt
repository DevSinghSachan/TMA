Haiyang,
Your description assessment is correct.  Going beyond a pipeline of LDA
followed by clustering (in the reduced feature space), you can construct a
joint co-clustering model that clusters both terms and documents.  Shafiei &
Milios have proposed one such model, and Wallach's dissertation suggests
another possibility.
Regards,
