I have downloaded the code for CTM and built it on my laptop. I tried
random and seeded CTM, while the random version gave the answer relatively
fast (1-2 minutes), the seeded version ran too slow (I ran it for 1 hour
but no result returned). I'm wondering is there any bug in my
pre-processing program. Can anyone give me some hint on this.
