I have been trying to find the expectation of (log of) linear
transformations of a dirichlet distributed random variable. Does anyone
have any pointers on how to go about it?
More precisely suppose,
\pi = {\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_K} ~ Dir(\alpha)
I know E[\pi_i] = {\alpha_i}/{\alpha_0}
(where \alpha_0 = \sum \alpha_i)
and E[\ln (\pi_i)] = \psi(\alpha_i) - \psi( \alpha_0)
(where \psi is the digamma function.)
Is there a way to compute the value of E[\ln (\sum_i (a_i * \pi_i)]
where a_i's are some positive constants.
Regards,
Nikhil
