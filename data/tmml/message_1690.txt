Call For Participation
WWW'12 Workshop on Mining Social Network Dynamics
In conjunction with World Wide Web (WWW?12) Conference
(http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/msnd)
16 April 2012
Lyon, France
*********************************************************************
Mining Social Network Dynamics Workshop (MSND) aims at gathering
researchers from the fields of social computing, machine learning, and
data mining to think about the obstacles that hurdle the leveraging of
understanding and capturing of social network dynamics. We target
researchers from both industry and academia to join forces in this
exciting area. We intend to discuss the recent and significant
developments in the general area of mining social network dynamics and
to promote cross-fertilization of techniques. In particular, we aim at
identifying techniques from the data mining and machine learning
fields that will enable researchers to understand the dynamic
phenomena in social networks and social media, as well as specify
important directions for the research communities. Understanding,
capturing, mining and being able to predict dynamic behaviors is
interesting for several areas such as marketing, security, and Web
search.
Exciting news: MSND will include a special session around social
networks for journalism. This session was initially planned and
organized at SMANE 2012. Our workshop will receive in the same
occasion 4 papers for presentation coming from the same workshop.
Please see the program below for more details.

Abstract of the keynote speaker:
Influence and Homophily in Networked User Behavior. Eytan Bakshy
(Facebook)
Social networks act as pathways for information diffusion, but to what
extent does social information affect individual sharing decisions? We
conduct field experiments that randomize the number of social signals
(cues) that users receive about content.  This design allows us to
rigorously evaluate how social signals influence sharing behavior,
above and beyond correlations that arise from homophily. We find that
the number of sharing friends an individual has, and the strength of
ties with those friends, is a significant predictor of whether an
individual shares content, even when no social information is
displayed. In addition, the number of friends shown has a significant
but relatively modest increase in the likelihood of sharing compared
to the baseline condition in which no friends are displayed. Our work
highlights how both practitioners and researchers alike can benefit
