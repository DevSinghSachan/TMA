I used to use visio (sorry I was raised on windows ;). For my thesis is switched to tikz which is a graphics package for LaTex.
Eventually I started using a visual notation that is a hybrid between bayes nets (boiler plate diagrams) and factor graphs in order to distinguish intractable models from nested models: http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~dietz/dirfactor-notation.pdf
If you need macros for tikz or shapes fir visio, let me know!
Cheers,
Laura
