Hi Ian,
You could do this in a number of ways.  A couple of simple approaches are:
1. Explicity model correlation between topics with a correlated topic
model (D. Blei and J. Lafferty. *Correlated Topic Models*. * Neural
Information Processing Systems*, 2006.

2. Run a topic model like LDA and then find similarity between topics
using your favorite metric, e.g. Hellinger distance:
