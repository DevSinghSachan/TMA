hi topic modelers,
i'm new to graphical topic models, but familiar w/ matrix
factorization methods like nmf
i found, and really enjoyed, this thread comparing lda w/ nmf:
https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/pipermail/topic-models/2009-February/000484.html
i have a related question
is there an lda equivalent to a loss function that measures how well
the topic + topic assignments approximate the original matrix??
the closest thing i found was perplexity -- but i'm not sure it's the
same thing?
