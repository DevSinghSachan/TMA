dear shuiwang,
yes, the second term should have \sum_{i=1}^{K}.  this is a typo.
thanks for catching it!
by inspection.  observe that the derivative is 0 when \gamma_i is set
to the expression in (17).
however, i now prefer a more general derivation of the same algorithm
using the machinery of exponential family models and conditionally
conjugate distributions.  this has been derived several times.  see
one of the following references for details:

i assume that you mean section A.4.2.  indeed, this is another typo.
there should be an M before the second term.  thanks for pointing it
out.
best,
dave
