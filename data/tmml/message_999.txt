Hello Bernard Brosseau-Villeneuve,
In answer to your first question, check out Newman, Chemudugunta and
Smyth in KDD 2006:

Or my work with Heymann, Manning, and Garcia-Molina in WSDM 2009:
http://www.stanford.edu/~dramage/papers/cluster-wsdm09.pdf
These are models that generate observations from more than one kind of
feature using a shared per-document multinomial theta.  For instance, in
our WSDM paper, we treated words, tags, and anchor text as parallel sets
of observations within each document.
