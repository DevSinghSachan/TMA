Hi,
I am new to LDA. I am using BibbsLDA++ to generate 100 topics. The
result is a file, which contains the topic-document distributions. Each
line is a document and each column is a topic. This file give me a
distribution for each document across 100 topics. However, what I want
to get it the distribution of each topic across all the document. How to
do it?
Thanks!
