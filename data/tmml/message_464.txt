Hi list readers,
I am curious about one thing mentioned in Topic Models by Blei and
Lafferty [2009]. They mention TFIDF used as a weighting scheme for the
whole corpus to pick up essential words which they later put into the
vocabulary which is used in training the model. How exactly would
TFIDF work for a corpus, as it's a document level weighting scheme
rather than corpus wide one. I guess applying TFIDF for every document
and then picking up most important words from the document and
repeating the process for every document in the corpus wont do. So my
question is : what exactly is TFIDF on a corpus level ?
