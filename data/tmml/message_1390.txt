hi ian
that figure (at 5:36) was made with the correlated topic model, which
is described in the paper sean pointed you to.  the correlation refers
to correlation between topic weights within documents.  for example,
an article partly about "sports" is more likely to also be about
"health" than "astronomy."
for a cheap way of obtaining these kinds of connections, you can try
to compute the correlation matrix of E[\theta_d], the expected topic
proportions for each document.  (i'd take logs first.)
