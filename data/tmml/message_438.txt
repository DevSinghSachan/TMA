Dear Neal,

imposing an (absolute) ordering on topics seems not generally viable
(such as by size (counts n_k) or by looking at high probabilities of
specific terms (parameters phi_kt)). It may work under specific
conditions for specific data sets, however.
After measuring the dynamics of the latent variables z in several Gibbs
sampling experiments on LDA and similar models, I can confirm Laura's
experience that "label switching" never occured even before the Gibbs
sampler has reached its target distribution (speaking of text corpora
with W=10^5..10^7 words and "reasonable" initial parametrisations).
To verify that topic indices remain unpermuted between samples, why not
compare the topic-term distributions (phi_k = p(w|z=k)) between samples
