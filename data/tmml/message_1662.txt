*Choice Models and Preference Learning
Workshop<https://sites.google.com/site/cmplnips11/>
*NIPS <http://nips.cc/Conferences/2011/> Workshop, 16/17 December 2011,
Sierra Nevada, Spain*
*Introduction*:
Preference learning has been studied for several decades and has drawn
increasing attention in recent years due to its importance in diverse
applications such as web search, ad serving, information retrieval, recommender
systems, electronic commerce, and many others. In all of these applications,
we observe (often discrete) choices that reflect preferences among several
entities, such as documents, webpages, products, songs etc. Since the
observation then is partial, or censored, the goal is to learn the complete
preference model, e.g.  to reconstruct a general ordering function from
observed preferences.
Traditionally, preference learning has been studied independently in several
research areas, such as machine learning, data and web mining, artificial
intelligence, recommendation systems, and psychology among others, with a
high diversity of application domains such as social networks,
information retrieval,
web search, medicine, biology, etc. However, contributions developed in one
application domain can, and should, impact other domains. One goal of this
workshop is to foster this type of interdisciplinary exchange, by
encouraging abstraction of the underlying problem (and solution)
characteristics during presentation and discussion. In particular, the
workshop is motivated by the two following lines of research:
*1. Large scale preference learning with sparse data:* There has been a
great interest and take-up of machine learning techniques for preference
learning in learning to rank, information retrieval and recommender systems,
as supported by the large proportion of preference learning based literature
in the widely regarded conferences such as *SIGIR*, *WSDM*, *WWW*, *CIKM*.
Different paradigms of machine learning have been further developed and
applied to these challenging problems, particularly when there is a
large number
of users and items but only a small set of user preferences are provided.
*2. Personalization in social networks: *recent wide acceptance of social
networks has brought great opportunities for services in different domains,
thanks to *Facebook*, *Linkin*, *Douban*, *Twitter*, etc. It is important
for these service providers to offer personalized service (e.g.,
personalization
of Twitter recommendations).  Social information can improve the inference
for user preferences. However, it is still challenging to infer user
preferences based on social relationship.
As such, we especially encourage submissions on theory, methods, and
applications focusing on large-scale preference learning in social media. In
order to avoid a dispersed research workshop, we solicit submissions
(papers, demos and project descriptions) and participation that specifically
tackle the research areas as below:
- Preference elicitation
- Ranking aggregation
- Choice models and inference
- Statistical relational learning for preferences
- Link prediction for preferences
- Learning Structured Preferences
- Multi-task preference learning
- (Social) collaborative filtering
*Important Dates:*
- Paper submission deadline: *25   October      2011*
- Author notification:               5     November    2011
- Final paper due:                   1     December   2011
- Workshop date:                16/17 December  2011 *

*Submission Instructions:*
- We solicit extended abstracts using the NIPS style files ( available
here <http://nips.cc/PaperInformation/StyleFiles> ). There is no page
limit for submissions, however, a one-page summary by itself will not
suffice. Submissions should include the title, authors' names, and email
addresses. Note that we do not plan to publish the workshop proceedings, and
we leave the choices of final venues (e.g., conferences or journals) to the
authors.
- Papers should be submitted to the EasyChair system at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmpl2011.
- We are seeking funds to publish the talks on
Videolecture.net<http://videolecture.net/>
*Program:*
