Laura,
I agree with your hypothesis and analysis, and this was borne out in Walker
& Ringger's 2008 KDD paper referenced earlier in the thread for the mixture
of multinomial model. They ran an experiment to test for label switching
which did NOT occur, for the reasons you mentioned. Interestingly, and both
"averaging samples" (using the posterior marginal distributions of the
individual latent variables) and taking the MAP/highest likelihood sample
usually worked best. It would be interesting to see a similar analysis for
LDA.
