Dear List:
My first time writing to this list. :) I have gone through the archive of
this mailing list back since last year regarding some of the discussion on
the collapsed variational inference for LDA (Teh, Newman, and Welling's
NIPS 2006 paper). However, I'm still not quite clear how Equation 15 is
derived (by expanding the log of ratio of Gamma functions as described by
the authors). Can anyone please explain this step in detail? I apologize
if this might come across as a stupid question.
Thank you very much in advance.
