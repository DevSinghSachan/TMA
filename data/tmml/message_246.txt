hi laura
i've had good luck using metropolis hastings interleaved with gibbs
sampling.  you can read about it in casella and robert or gelman et al.
in the exchangeable dirichlet, the single parameter is much like the
scaling parameter in the DP.  so, you can also use the tricks in
escobar and west for sampling that parameter.
i hope this helps.
best,
dave
