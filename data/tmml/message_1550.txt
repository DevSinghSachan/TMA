Dear all,
I am sorry about taking your time to answer some questions about applying Gibbs sampling for supervised LDA.
As we known, Jonathan Chang has provided the demo of Gibbs sampling for sLDA in his R package for LDA. In this demo, slda.em.R uses a function ".slda.collapsed.gibbs.sampler" which cannot be found in this demo. Therefore, I cannot catch the idea of the Gibbs sampling for sLDA very much. In the previous mail of topic-models, Jonathan Chang has provided a draft documentation [1] on the exact sampling equations. For sLDA of [1], p(y_d|z_d,b,a) is added, and the Likelihood function for Gibbs sampling is obtained as (D.24). But I don't  know how to update the value of y_d and z_d in the iteration of Gibbs sampling. And whether the values of a and b are constant or not? How to set the values of a and b?
Could anyone please help me on these questions or please let me know if there is any reference on this? I really appreciate your help.
