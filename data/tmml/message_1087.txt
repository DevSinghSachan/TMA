Hello,
I spent quite some time now to get the "Topic Modeling Toolbox"
(http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/programs_data/toolbox.htm) running on
our 64-bit Debian machines, but unfortunately it doesn't work.
When I try to execute the GibbsSamplerLDACOL function, I receive an
error message:
I am new to Matlab, but after some search in the web I think I figured
out what seems to cause this problem. It seems that the source code of
the Toolbox is out-of-date and does not comply with latest 64-bit
versions of the Matlab distribution.
The actual source code of the Toolbox is written in C++ and gets
converted into executable Matlab files (*.m). The tool that is used for
this compilation step is called "mex". I also tested it with using the
"-largeArrayDims" option for mex, but this didn't help either.
Using a current version of Matlab (R2010a), I observed that the
compilation step does succeed, but executing the resulting Matlab files
produces the aforementioned error message. Hence, the error occurs at
running time.
I think the Toolbox functions attempt to pass variables of a
non-compatible 32-bit type to library functions of the Matlab code that
expect to get 64-bit variables. Normally, 64-bit code should be able to
handle 32-bit variables, but apparently in this case it's not.
Unfortunately, I am more used to Java and not familiar with such details
of C code.
Can anyone help me with this problem? Are there other implementations of
the LDACOL and Author-Topic-LDA model? As it seems, maintenance of the
Toolbox has stopped some time ago.
Best regards,
Sebastian
