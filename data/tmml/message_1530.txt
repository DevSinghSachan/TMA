hi Sinead,
thanks a lot for your explaination and attachment. when i expand the  \mathbb{V}[Y\dagger|\alpha, \gamma], i got a different answer from yours. i have download the matlab code you provided, and i use the taylor to expand \mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{2^{X+Y}(n_{.,\neg i}^{(m)}+X+Y)}], but the answer is not same as yours. attachment is my derivation. maybe i miss something.
kind regard
