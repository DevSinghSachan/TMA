Dear list members,
does anyone know work that uses variances in addition to the
means/expectations of document-scope topic distributions in generative
topic models ? All I could find into this direction are segment-scope
topic distributions (Shafiei and Milios 2006) that can account for the
variability of the topic across a document.
Thanks for a hint
