Hello,
I'm having trouble running lda-c, I'm trying under MinGW and MSys, data
can't be read properly as the fscanf function doesn't work properly,
resulting in an infinite loop.
It looks like it can read the first integer on the first line of the
file, the number of different words in the document (say, 723), but then
it can't read any of the "word_id:word_count" structures. Then, it
doesn't go to the next line, reading the first integer (723) again. Any
suggestions on how could I fix this problem? Is it specific of MinGW,
perhaps?
I also have another question. I'm trying to do some inference - in fact,
clustering and ordering for relevance to a user query - on a number of
relatively short strings (6-20 different words each). Using the lda
package from Daichi Mochihashi I was able to estimate a model with only
18 topics, while I'm sure there are more in the data (the likelihood
would converge early with more topics).
In my opinion, these strings are clearly too short to estimate a model
of their own from them. Before I considered LDA, I analyzed them using
LSA, using a set of related - and much larger - documents to estimate
the loadings matrix for the PCA. In fact, the short strings are
descriptions of administrative procedures and the training documents are
the laws on which these procedures are based. The vocabulary is some
90-95% the same and results for LSA, though clearly not optimal, were
quite good.
Do you think that a similar procedure would be feasible with LDA? I'm
going to estimate a model with 128 topics on the laws and then calculate
gammas of the strings using that model: then, I'll try to cluster them.
Any suggestions? I'm going to need a distance function for this.
I know it's a lot of reading, especially for a first time poster, but I
don't know where else could I ask. :)
Best regards,
Matteo Dimai
