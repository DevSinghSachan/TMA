I am using Dr. Teh's hdp code to analyze a corpus. It seems that the choice
of topic prior, eta, really affects the number of topics a lot.
If I use eta=0.01, the program outputs around 150 topics, but if eta=0.2,
there are only 20 topics. For eat=0.5, only around 10 topics.
My question is: how to decide the setting of eta in practice?
Thanks a lot!
Sincerely,
Ning
