hi all,
great!  in order to make this plan concrete, let's meet at kirin
restaurant at 6:00PM.  (it's early so that those who are presenting
can be at the poster session by 7:30PM.)
information is here:
http://www.kirinrestaurant.com/english/home.htm
and we'll just get as many tables as needed.
best,
dave
PS. i've never eaten at kirin.  if someone has another suggestion, by
all means, feel free to assert it.
