Dear all,
I am implementing "Supervised topic model" in Matlab language, following the paper by Blei and McAuliffe.
I encounter a problem: after about 30 iterations of EM (corpus level), the per-document log-likelihood becomes NaN (Not a number).
In my code, the vbem (document level) iterates for 200 times without convergence analysis. Is NaN problem due to too many vbem iteration times?
I have checked my code for several times, and couldn't find out how to fix it.
Interestingly, there is also a NaN check in Blei's code of LDA:
assert(!isnan(likelihood));
So is it a general problem in topic model related program?
Thank you in advance.
Best,
Kevin
