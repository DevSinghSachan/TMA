Hi,
I am new to this area. I want to use LDA C code on professor Blei's homepage to analyze some collections of documents, but I am not sure how to turn my documents into the data file format that is required according to the readme.txt of the code.
Could anyone tell me how to do it? Or is there any code available to do it? I really appreciate it.
Thank you very much!
Sincerely,
Ning Zheng
