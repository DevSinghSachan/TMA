dear david,
your intuition is correct.  i'm sorry that it was confusing in the
paper.
the z's are *level* assignments.  suppose a document has half it's
words assigned to the root and half assigned to level 1.  sampling
the path for that document amounts to considering the different
possible paths with the level assignments set per the current values
of the z variables.
best,
dave
