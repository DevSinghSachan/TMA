Dear All,
While reading the JMLR version of the LDA paper, I have the following
specific questions about the derivation in the Appendix. Can anybody help
me?
1. In Section A.3.2, do we need a summation like $\sum_{i=1}^k$ in the
second term of the first equation in this section?
2. In Section A.3.2, how did you get Eq. 17 from the equation above it by
setting it to zero?
3. In Section A.4.1 on the last page, how did you get the last equation
about the second derivative from the equation above it? In particular, why
the constant $M$ only appears in the first term while not in the second
term?
Thank you in advance!
Shuiwang
