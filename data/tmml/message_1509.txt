Hi all
Could anyone help to offer available urls to download the Standford
twitter dataset or other benchmarks for classified microblog
Recently I feel interesting to do some testing on microblog, compared
with normal text, so seeking for a benchmark is a must. Has any
previous work be made on such a benchmark?
Thanks
Ethan
