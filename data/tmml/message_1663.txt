distribution...
order to describe what I >  want to achieve with Dirichet Distribution
with a fixed number of dimensions... In
Actually, the DP is the only somewhat conjugate way I know of handling
a Dirichlet.  By that I mean, if the base distribution H is discrete and
finite,
then basically the DP and the Dirichlet are the same thing:
DP(H,g) \equiv Dirichlet(gH)
The parameter $g$ is called a "concentration" parameter for both
because its basically an inverse variance.
So use standard HDP methods to address hierarchical Dirichlets.
We've done this for a few years in topic modelling,
e.g.,   our papers in ECML-PKDD 2009, ECML-PKDD 2011
The 2011 paper gives a better sampler for the HDP.
