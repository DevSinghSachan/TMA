Hi,
I'm looking for Prof. Michael Jordan's notes titled 'Introduction to
Probabilistic Graphical Models' (2009) (organized in the form of a book with
chapters). It appears that Prof. Jordan's notes have been widely used by
instructors at a number of universities, but I can't tell whether these
notes are freely available or only circulated with permission of the author.
I have been able to find a 2003 version of these notes by Googling, but was
wondering if anyone would be able to share the 2009 version (assuming the
notes can be shared freely).
Regards,
Suhas
