You're right I believe.  Properly speaking, \beta in equation 6 should be
replaced by \exp(\digamma(\lambda)).  For the record,
\exp(\digamma(\lambda)) grows as \lambda when \lambda is sufficiently
large;making that substitution would
be equivalent to taking an unnormalized point estimate of \beta.
