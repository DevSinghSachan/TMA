Hi all,
Thanks for all of your interesting suggestions. Laura, your experimental
results are extremely interesting, thanks for the link!
Xavier, I don't think the automatically determined genres will correspond
precisely to the usual idea of what makes a genre, but rather to groups of
artists that a certain type of music listener tends to listen to.
I have also been thinking about the potential sparsity of the data. Users
that have listened to just one artist or who have made just one download
(which represents a very significant portion of my dataset) may not have a
meaningful topic distribution, but my hope is that their topic distribution
will give much weight to the genre that has the highest probability for the
one artist they have listened to, and so their recommendation list will just
be the other artists in that genre ranked by their probability within that
genre, which I feel is the most natural thing for a recommendation system to
do.
Thanks,
Harry
