Hi Yiliang,
We did something (sparse topical coding) different from the method of using sparse priors in a Bayesian setting.
The basic idea is to use sparse coding technique to do LDA-like document analysis.

The difference from LDA is that the document vector is no longer a normalized distribution; instead, it is a sparse weight vector
to linearly combine multiple topics (multi-normial distributions over vocabulary).
