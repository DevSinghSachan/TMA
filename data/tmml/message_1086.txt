Thanks for pointing this out, Dave!
Ed, you can specify a definition of a token in a command line option.
Here's an example that picks out any combination of unicode letters
and punctuation that ends with a letter:
% cat url-test
1	test	This is my punctuation test. I don't know if it works yet! I
like http://www.blah.com/index.php.
% bin/mallet import-file --input url-test --token-regex
'[\p{L}\p{P}]*\p{L}' --keep-sequence --print-output
name: 1
target: test
input: 0: this (0)
1: is (1)
2: my (2)
3: punctuation (3)
4: test (4)
5: i (5)
6: don't (6)
7: know (7)
8: if (8)
9: it (9)
10: works (10)
11: yet (11)
12: i (5)
13: like (12)
14: http://www.blah.com/index.php (13)
