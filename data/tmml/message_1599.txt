Dear all,
I am reading David Blei's correlated topic model C code, and in the
estimatic.c file line 103, there is a function called cov_shrinkage, which
is used to calculated covariance estimation in m-step of parameter
estimation stage.
But in both paper about correlated topic model, i.e. "Correlated Topic
Models" and "A correlated topic model of science", there is almost no
content about this algorithm, could anyone point it out to me which
shrinkage method is applied here or did I miss anything in the paper? Any
other reference paper about covariance shrinkage is also welcomed.
Thanks!
