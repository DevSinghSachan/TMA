Hi lykm,
Please see the document
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiLafferty2009.pdf
section 3.2 subsection "Choosing the vocabulary". My question is
related to the TFIDF used to get top V words. I can imagine doing that
on a single document, but I don't see how can I get global top words.
best,
Mateusz
