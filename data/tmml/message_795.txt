hi dave
i think that this is a promising idea.  i'm not sure if these
techniques have been used in a topic model.
there are annealing methods used in MCMC sampling.  for example, see
the discussion of "tempering" in robert and casella's book "monte
carlo statistical methods."  (they reference others, like radford
neal, who discusses annealing in his big MCMC tech report.)
best
dave
