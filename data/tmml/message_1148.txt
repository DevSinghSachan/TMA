Hello all,
I have been following the list for a few months now and would like to thank
you all for the educational questions and answers.  This field is really
interesting.
I hope this is not off topic here... I will be traveling to Europe this year
in late May or early to mid June, and I was hoping someone here might be
able to point me to a conference or workshop about topic models or other
branches/applications of text models.  Even somewhere I could sit in on a
class would be excellent.  It would be preferable if the material was mostly
in English, French or Italian.
Thanks,
William Riley-Land
