hi YW,
new york is the same :)
it's a little different.  when you set gamma = alpha + \sum_j phi_j
in the objective, phi_i is a term in the log gamma function,
log gamma(\alpha + \sum_j \phi_j)
which complicates the derivative w/r/t phi_i.  however, taking its
taylor approximation around alpha + \sum_{j \neq i} phi_j gives an
expression that yields the exact update for phi_i that i wrote down
earlier.  granted, i kind of reverse engineered this from your
algorithm, but i still think that it's interesting.
best,
dave
