Hello all,
I am a new person to this area.
I was reading the Latent Dirichlet Allocation paper (JMLR). When it comes to
the derivation of an expression for (phi)ni (due to non availability of the
greek font, I am writing it like this), we have a lagragian multiplier
appearing in the result of finding the derivative of L with respect to
(phi)ni. However the paper does not give any details as to how to get rid of
that term in the expression. Also the expression derived for (phi)ni in the
process and that used in the algorithm is slightly different(I mean one term
is missing)
So please help me in this derivation.
regards
veena
