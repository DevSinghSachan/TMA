Hello everyone,
since there have been several posts now about CTM not converging and getting
stuck in an infinite loop, I thought I should post a little workaround that
worked fine for me, meaning that I received reasonable results.
In the file inference.c and the function opt_lambda(...), there is this
do/while loop which is causing the problem. I noticed the commented line at
the end of the loop, specifying a different termination criterion. When I
use this instead of the original one, CTM doesn't get stuck anymore. I also
told David about this and he said that it isn't the best solution but should
work nevertheless and not influence the results.
I hope this helps a little,
Thomas
