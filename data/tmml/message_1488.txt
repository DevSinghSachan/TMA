Apologies for the delay in response. Yes, the variance in the unconditional
p(w) was intended to respect the rest of the model parameters in deriving a
measure of generality.
In all honesty i don't see the benefit of the weighted variance (and i
confess I'm not sure what you're proposing the sample would be). The
statistic i suggest could be computed quite simply using simulation. I
forget standard notation, so apologies if i write this unconventionally, but
if \Theta are your topic mixing proportions, which are dirichlet distributed
with parameter \gamma, and the probability of word i in topic z were
\beta_zi, then if you sample a bunch of p_j according to the following:
1. sample a vector of mixing proportions \theta_j from a dirichlet with
parameter gamma
2. sample z given \theta from a multinomial with parameter \theta
3. Set p_j to be \beta_zi for the z you just sampled
After a sufficient number of samples, the variance of the vector of samples
p will be a good approximate of the variance in the unconditional p(w_i).
1000 ought to be enough to give you a decent idea.
Hope that helps.
