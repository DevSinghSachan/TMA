Noortje,
I think you want to use DeltaLDA from David Andrzejewski
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~andrzeje/research/delta_lda.html
It is writting using python and NumPy and is quite efficient. It is a
special variant of LDA where you can have one of two different priors on
p(topic|doc) -- one for successful documents and one for failing
documents, setting them to the same values yields LDA. Maybe David's
code includes a vanilla LDA implementation as well...
Cheers,
Laura
