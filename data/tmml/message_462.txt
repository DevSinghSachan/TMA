Hello,
I am trying to use the lda-c code for learning the topics in the dataset
and and inference.
The inference method outputs a gamma.dat file and a likelihood.dat file.
How am I supposed to use this to derive the P(Z_k/D_m) (ie) how can get
the topic distribution over documents from the gamma and likelihood files.
Could some please help me by explaining this.
Thank you
Jagan
