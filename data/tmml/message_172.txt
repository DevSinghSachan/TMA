Hi,
I have a question about Pachinko Allocation Method ( PAM )
In the moment matching equations where we are estimating the components of
alpha_x using the mean_x_y and var_x_y, I am sometimes getting the values of
m_x_y negative, thus its log is undefined.
I am unable to proceed any further, is it a problem with the data or is
there a work-around in the model to handle such kind of cases
Thanks
