Hello,
Two papers I found interesting were:
a) H. M. Wallach, I. Murray, R. Salakhutdinov, and D. Mimno,
"Evaluation methods for topic models," in ICML, 2009. Talks about
computing perplexity quite extensively.
b) J. Chang, J. Boyd-Graber, S. Gerrish, C. Wang, and D. M. Blei,
"Reading Tea Leaves : How Humans Interpret Topic Models," in NIPS,
2009. Talks about correlating perplexity with human evaluation, and
they find a negative correlation there, and propose a metric of their
own.
Cheers,
