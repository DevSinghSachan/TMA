Hi,
I am struggling with the following problem. I have run LDA on a corpus and identified a (alpha,number of topics) pair that generates meaningful topics. Now I am trying to identify the most likely topic for each document, which from my understanding requires building a matrix holding the probability of doc i belonging to topic j.
I am using the attached R code, where
- beta.transpose is the transposed beta matrix generated by the LDA run
- freq-matrix is a matrix describing the distribution of words over the documents. Each row is a document, each column a word.
The problem is that there being 150k documents and approx 100k words (using stemming+stop words), freq-matrix is huge and cannot be held in memory.
Can anyone tell me how to do this operation in a more intelligent way? I am sure others on this list have struggled with this issue. I am very new to this kind of project.
Kind regards
