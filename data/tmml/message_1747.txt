Oh, Mr. Chong himself -- I love the topic-models list :)
But these topics look amazing.
Jonathan says he tried both his adapted code (Python) and your original code, with equally strange results, on the NYT dataset. So the difference must lie in data preprocessing.
Can you give more info on how to replicate your result? What particular dictionary did you use, what training parameters? I'd like to get to the bottom of this, so I can include HDP into gensim with clear conscience.
Best,
