Dear Topic modelers,
Is there any work on how specific an estimated topic is?  I can imagine a
situation in which two speakers both use the same topic, but do so with
differing levels of vagueness, for example a blog post along the lines of
''the movie 'Batman' was good'' versus ''I enjoyed the movie Batman 'Dark
Knight' (2008), staring Christian Beil and directed by Chris Nolan;
the cinematography was well done, and the plot compelling.''  Or, in a
political context, are there suitable topic models for distinguishing
between phrases such as ''we need tax cuts'' (without specifying which
taxes or how this would be accomplished)  and ''we need to reduce income
tax on people earning less than XXX '' (providing more details) ?
I have considered hLDA, but I don't think this exactly captures the issue
of 'ambiguous vs specific' topics.  Has anyone worked on this?
With thanks,
Scott
