Yeah - I have one buried somewhere on Github that attempted to fix things like
go seehttp://meb.tw.xxxx for details
and
htp:/bob.com
and
via at znmeb
where people miss a space before the "@" or "#" and don't type the
whole 'http://'. Twitter's parser doesn't fix this stuff, by the way.
What they've published (in Ruby) is at
http://github.com/mzsanford/twitter-text-rb
