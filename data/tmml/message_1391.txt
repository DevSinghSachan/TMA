hi topic-models,
does anyone have links to descriptions or summaries of industrial
applications of topic models?  i've seen a number of seo examples and some
arguments that search engines are applying them in some way, but aside from
grouping wikipedia into topics, are there known cases where topic models
have been applied?
thanks,
scott
