hi neal,
you ask interesting questions, but you are hijacking the topic
models list. both (1) the mathematical connections between
KL-divergence and hellinger distance and (2) the foundational
issues in empirical bayes are classical, well understood,
heavily explored, extensively documented issues in the statistical
literature. if you honestly cannot track down references, please
get in touch with me out of band and i will provide some pointers.
i and others have not been answering these questions on this list,
on purpose. specific topic modeling questions.
in the spirit of constructive criticism and attentional focus,
jon.
