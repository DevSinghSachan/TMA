Hi all,
I have very recently looked at the LDA model and tried to implement it in
java using the papers by Blei. I could understand the parameter estimation
part. However, I am unclear as to how can I estimate the relevance of a
document with respect to a query using this model. Could you please suggest
me in this regard or give me a reference where I can understand the
procedure?
Thanks in Advance
