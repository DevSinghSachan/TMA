Hi,
I believe a precise generalized definition of topic has been quite hard
to find even in the earlier days. May be we need to take a read at the
critical studies found at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topics_%28Aristotle%29. Personally I feel
tying "words" to the definition specializes it rather than representing
a generalization.
