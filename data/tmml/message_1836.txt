Dear All,
I am using mallet lda (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) on a set of images
represented b Bag-of-visual-words.
The settings are: #topics=500, alpha=0.001 (i want sparse document vector),
beta=0.01, #documents=10k+,#vocabulary=50k+
I have got the below message during iteration: (after a few iterations)
*[beta: NaN]
NaN after topic 0 0
<1550> LL/token: NaN
NaN after topic 0 0
<1560> LL/token: NaN
NaN after topic 0 0
<1570> LL/token: NaN*
May I know what is the implication of that? Or what do I need to do for the
settings?
Thank you!!
