Hi,
I consider the following variant of topic models:
(1) We have K topics where K is known in advance.
(2) We have multiple clusters of these topics, each of which contains
the K topics from (1). The number of clusters is not known.
For example, we might have a large corpus about sports. The topics may
be football, basketball and baseball. In addition, we want to
distinguish between articles describing sports events from different
places but do not know the division in advance (i.e we want to cluster
the articles but do not know to how many clusters).  Clustering might
be made according to Europe vs. US (in which case we have two topic
clusters, each of which with three topics - football, basketball and
baseball), or Europe vs. US vs. Asia (3 clusters of 3 topics) and so
on.
The motivation is that we can assume that in different parts of the
world the language model of each topic is somewhat different, but the
same topics (at least approximately) hold.
I wonder if this model has been addressed in the literature and if
anyone is familiar with an algorithm/implementation of it.
Thanks,
Roi Reichart
