Dear mailing list members,
I am curious how to use Pachinko allocation to measure document similarity.
Given LDA that assumes that topics are independent and learns a topic
distribution for each document, we can measure the similarity/divergence
between documents by Jensen Shannon divergence.  Whereas PA learns a
hierarchy of topics, is it still reasonable to use Jensen Shannon
divergence?
Any hint is highly appreciated.
Best,
Yi Wang
