Dear Members,
In correlated topic model, we assume some non-zero off-diagonal entries
in the co-variance matrix of the normal distribution. Does it make any sense
in the LDA framework to make all the topic components independent so that
the co-variance matrix becomes diagonal? In case of Dirichlet distribution
in the original LDA paper, there is just one constraint on the topic
components (sampled from simplex) so that they are not completely
independent. On the other hand, in the dynamic topic model paper, the
authors assumed diagonal co-variance. Can anyone please explain me the
significance?
Thanks,
Ayan Acharya
