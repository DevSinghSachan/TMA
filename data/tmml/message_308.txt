Hi all,
I would like to use the LDA c-code for image classification.
I have 5 semantic classes and for each class, i used LDA code for the
estimation and got alpha, beta and gamma files.
Then for all the images of the testing database, i did inference for
each semantic class, using their respective models.
At the end i got 5 gamma files and five likelihood files (one per class).
Now i would like to make a decision in order to know which image of the
testing database belong to which semantic class. I wonder if i can use
the likelihood files and decide that an image belong to the class which
maximises the likelihood among the five values for that image.  I'm not
sure of that. Maybe there is a better way to do that.
Can anybody help me?
Thanks
