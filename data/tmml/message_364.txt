Dear Topic model list,
I've managed to get the CTM C code working on a linux machine, but now I'm
having problems with the R code for the lasso. In particular, I'm getting
this error message:
".Error in l1ce(y ~ X, data = data, sweep.out = ~1, bound = lambda) :
you cannot sweep out all the variables"
I'm not quite sure where to go from here  and would appreciate some advice.
Thanks!
David
