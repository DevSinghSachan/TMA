Hi David & Laura,
Thanks for your responses, they're helpful. It sounds like stemming
might be useful in situations where one doesn't care about subtle
distinctions in inflections, but rather just the semantic distinctions
themselves (i.e. just give me one "M. Varro citations" topic, rather
than finding two different ones). For my purposes, I should probably
give stemming a try.
Thanks,
Neal
