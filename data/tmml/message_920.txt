Hi Azeem,
As one of the co-authors of Labeled LDA, I am very glad you are using this
model for multi-labeled documents!
I will be glad to assist, but can you please tell me a bit more about what
exactly do you mean by "unsatisfactory performance"? Can you describe in
more detail what kind of topics the model is performing poorly on? (e.g.:
sub-topics,  rare topics, etc.)  How do the F1 numbers on these topics
compare to the topics that is doing well on? Are you using any smoothing for
the topic-specific distributions over words?
Thanks
-Ramesh
