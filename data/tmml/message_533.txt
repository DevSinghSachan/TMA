Hi Neal,
The most common similarity measure between two distributions that I have
known is the KL divergence. The other technique is the query likelihood
approach.
In the following document
"Notes on the KL-divergence retrieval formula and
Dirichlet prior smoothing"
you will find why is one same as the other.
and b, where each sequence adds up to 1, its easy to treat them as 1-d
distribution and compute using the KL divergence formula
Hope this helps,
Shivani
