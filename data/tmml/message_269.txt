Hi list,
I'd like to verify that my implementation of the nCRP is valid -- for each
iteration, is it appropriate to simply multiply the CRP probability for each
node in a path? (i.e., the number of documents present at each node divided
by the total number of documents + gamma - 1)
Or do we need to calculate the full probability (num_classes * log(gamma) +
sum(gammaln(# docs at each node) - gammaln(gamma + total # docs)
+gammaln(gamma))?
Thanks!
David
