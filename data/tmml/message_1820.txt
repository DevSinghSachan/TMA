Deal All,
When we use topic models, for example LDA and HDP, is there a way to make
the document vector sparse?
For example, if we set the number of topics to be 5 in LDA, instead of
getting a document vector over topics to be [0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2], we
prefer [0,0.5,0,0,0.5] or [0,1,0,0,0]
Is there a way to ensure the sparsity of document vector?
Thank you!
