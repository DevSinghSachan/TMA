Hi All!
I have been thinking hard about this and just feel its time to ask for help. Sorry if this sounds elementary but thats just where i am at on the? learning curve.
My question is this:
?How should i go about formulating an HDP model where
- The 'words' are to be drawn as pairs of two types. Imagine if each word in the pair comes from 2 different codebooks. For example let the pair ' XY' like in human genotype. Suppose the Xs are a type of word and the Ys are a type of word, each having their codebook and the pairing is assumed random for each 'XY' word.
- I suppose each XY pair word will be sampled simultaneously. the X part from its topic distribution z \x and the Y part from z /y
- Both topic z \x and z \y have a common prior Gj which is drawn from Go with base distribution H.
I am wondering how to represent Gj to show this. Will i have to have two observed nodes for the words, to reflect that sampling is done in pairs from the two codebooks of words?
What if we could fix the number of topics for one type of words? How do i capture that?
How do i come up wit the posterior distribution? given the observed pair and the othe HDP parameters?
What is the process of deriving a gibbs sampler for such a system?
I am still trying to find my feet with understanding and using the HDP concept and will appreciate it if someone can guide my thoughts. Relevant papers suggestion will be appreciated.
In using the HDP concept to model a problem, what are the fundamental steps to consider?
Thanks for your time.
