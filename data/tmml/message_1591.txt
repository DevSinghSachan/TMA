Hi topic modelers,
Given the recent resurgence/success of neural nets, i'm curious how
they'll do w/ topic modeling
I did some exploring, and found Ruslan Salakhutdinov's -- 'Replicated
Softmax: an Undirected Topic Model'
Ruslan details a RBM based topic model, and tests it's performance
using Annealed Importance Sampling
I'm curious about two things:
Is Annealed Importance Sampling the best method for general model
assessment? I found this thread which seems to imply it's not --
https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/pipermail/topic-models/2010-March/000758.html
Has anyone else gone down this path (topic modeling w/ neural nets)?
What are some of the hurdles to be aware of?
Thanks,
Timmy Wilson
