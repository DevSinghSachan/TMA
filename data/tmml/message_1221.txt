Brendan,
I know of a couple recent papers that did some comparisons between
LDA-based methods for classification and SVMs.
- Jun Zhu and colleagues have some comparisons between MedLDA, sLDA, and
LDA+SVMs in their MedLDA paper:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~junzhu/pub/medlda_icml09.pdf
- In a recent paper (in press), some colleagues and I did a fairly thorough
empirical comparison between several LDA-based models and SVMs, for
multi-label classification.  Here's the arXiv preprint:
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2462
With respect to the issue you mentioned regarding the number of training
samples:
In our work, we found that the performance of LDA-based models and SVMs was
highly dependent on statistics of the dataset.  Briefly:
- LDA-based methods (and in particular, the "Dependency-LDA" model), had a
very clear advantage over SVMs for large scale corpora that have many
labels and relatively little training data for most labels
-  On datasets with fewer labels, and many training examples per label,
SVMs had an  advantage over the LDA-based methods.
We did not look at the performance of sLDA, so can't say anything
definitively about sLDA vs. SVMs.  However, for some of the reasons we
discussed in our paper, I wouldn't be surprised if SVM performance relative
to sLDA increases as the amount of training data increases.
