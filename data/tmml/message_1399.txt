Hello list-members:
I was looking for an implementation of discrete-time dynamic topic models
(dDTM). I could find implementations of LDA, sLDA, cLDA, and more complex
modifications of LDA. However, I could not find if the also implemented dDTM
(I read the README files mostly).
I am sure there must be an implementation of dDTM. Could you please point to
the right place? (sincere apologies if it is included in lda-c or ctm-dist)
Thanks in advance for your help.
Best Regards,
S.
