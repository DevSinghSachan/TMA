Hello Kevin and List,
I work on a MATLAB version of LDA and had the same problem when computing
the log likelihood. You didn't mention how do you compute it, but, from my
experience, working in the log space didn't prevent the numarical
instability and the NaN problem remained . The solution that worked
(provided thankfully to us by David Blei) was to use the approximation of
log(a+b) from log(a) and log(b) instead of computing the exact log of sums.
I hope this information is relevant and useful.
Best,
Loulou
