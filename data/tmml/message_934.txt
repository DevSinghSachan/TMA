Hi Tanmoy
I didn't ask this..
In this paper, N should be the number of words in a document, right? N is
drawn from some distribution (e.g. poisson). But the author also makes an
assumption that the number of topics is also N. You can find this in section
3 of this paper. I think the number of topics should be k, which is the
dimension of theta. Please note that \theta_1, \theta_2, ...., \theta_k
determines a multinomial distribution from which topics are generated.
I did know gibbs sampling..but I'm asking the differences and advantages of
these approximate inference methods..Also, if you don't understand how
variational methods use a simplified graph to approximate the original
graphical model, you should read the section 4 of Blei's paper again. I
think the basic idea is to introduce two "hidden" parameters \gamma and \phi
in order to simplify the model. There are graphical representations which
help you understand.
Thanks for your advice!
