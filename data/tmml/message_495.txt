Dear list,
Somebody says we can average over samples of iterations B, 2B, 3B ... ,
where B is the length of the burn-in period. I have some confusion about
this. Gibbs sampling is a random process. As the sampler goes on, is it
possible that two different topics change their position, and how
possible? If that does happen, we just can't average them, because we
don't know the mapping between the two parameter sets of two iterations
respectively.
I will be grateful if someone make that clear to me!
thanks,
shaobs
