Hi everyone:
At first, thanks for your detailed reply to my first question.
So far as I know in most of current Gibbs sampling methods, the \alpha and
\beta are given  previously without a learning process. Is there any way or
published work aims at learning them in Gibbs sampling? Since EM can be used to
learn parameters,can EM and Gibbs sampling combine together?
I have talked about this with shao, but because of my fool I couldnot follow
him. It will be greatly appreicated if any of you could give me another detailed
instruction.
Thanks again and best regards!
