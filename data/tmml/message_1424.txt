Hi Henry,
The relative probabilities of topics are stored in
p[i] for i 1 ... T
you want to sample from that vector.
Math.random() gives you a float in [0,1),
and the for loop is meant to check "in which bin"
the random draw happened to fall in.

PS: The cool part about Gibbs sampling is that we don't actually
need to know the exact prob of topic k -- just their relative sizes,
which saves us from having to calculate the normalization const.
