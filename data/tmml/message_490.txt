Dear All:
Sorry for interrupting. I'm recently using mallet package for topic model training. I've sent the problem to mallet mail list, but received no response. So I come here to see if anyone has met with similar problem.
I'm having a problem trying to use LDAStream for LDA training. When trained on the dataset attatched, it always reports the LDAHyper sampling error. I checked that this error message comes from LDAHyper.sampleTopicsForOneDoc() function, in the following segment:
if (sample < topicTermMass) {
//topicTermCount++;
i = -1;
while (sample > 0) {
i++;
sample -= topicTermScores[i];
newTopic = topicTermIndices[i];
When executing this segment, sample<0 and sample<topicTermMass, causing i=-1; I fixed this problem by adding
if(i>=0) newTopic = topicTermIndices[i];
Unfortunately, this further causes the following problem:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: alpha and beta must be strictly positive.

It seems the updated alpha and beta are below zero.
How this problem could be fixed? Has anyone met with similar problem? I tried on several other datasets, and it works well. However, when performed on the attatched dataset, the problem occurs.
Best
