Hashtags, usernames, URLs, and emoticons, multi-character punctuation,
and celebrity names were the token classes we modeled to get topics that
seemed right in our ICWSM paper this year.

There's an online demo here if you're silverlight inclined:

The celebrity name tokenization rule was important because, with it, you
learn topics for music and celeb culture; without it, you end up
learning topics with a bunch of first names.
For our purpose, it was better to *not* normalize spelling and
punctuation variations.  If you don't normalize things like dat/wit ->
that/with you end up with nice clusters of words indicative of
particular speaker communities' linguistic styles.
