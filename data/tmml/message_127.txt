I can comment on the suitability of these techniques for
commercialization based on my experience building a text search
application.
I was working at a startup last year that was trying to apply
techniques in the LDA family to clustering in fairly
narrowly-specified web / email corpora.  I was responsible for
implementing, testing, and applying the statistical code.  One of
these corpora was  different from those commonly used in the
literature in that the types of prose, subject matter, and style
varied more widely, (you could call it a more sparse set,) while the
other was quite standard.  We tried many model variations and pre /
post processing techniques, but these problems remained as barriers to
use in a product:
- While the best subjectively-evaluated-for-coherence topics often
had a fairly clear semantic theme, these topics were only about 5-10%
of the total number of topics.  Another 5-10% were totally useless,
and the middle 80-90% gave some sense of coherence but often suffered
