Is there any way of preventing label-switching by imposing some kind
of arbitrary ordering on the topics? I've vaguely heard of people
doing this sort of thing when using MCMC in other contexts, but don't
know any details or whether it could apply here.
Also, for averaging, are there standard diagnostics (e.g.
autocorrelation statistics) that people tend to use in deciding
whether to average all the samples after a burn-in period or to pick
samples at some interval and just average those? Or do you just look
at, say, time series of hyperparameters and average if they look like
white noise?
