I came across the following comment recently,
"LDA as well as pLSA are very popular in the literature, but all
examples of their use on text, when carefully considered, are
unsuccessful."
Does anyone have an idea of how and/or why someone would reach such a
conclusion? Are there real world applications, examples and/or studies
that disprove the assertion?
