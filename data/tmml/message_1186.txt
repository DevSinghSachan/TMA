Hi Pradipto,
Thanks for the reply. I looked at the paper by the stanford guys. What I
try to do is something similar to the work but I want to allow different
strengths (say through some parameter $\alpha$ lying between 0 to 1) to the
two different sets of observations (i.e. the user provided tags and the
words in the documents). Is there a formal way to introduce and learn this
parameter in such framework?
Thanks,
