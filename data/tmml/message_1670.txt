Hi Dave,
Option 2 is definitely not kosher as such; it's going to give you
wrong estimates for means and might dramatically understate marginal
variances if there's substantial correlation between variables (which
there usually is). OTOH, you could combine 1 and 2, averaging the
conditional distributions across multiple iterations. That is, burn in
the sampler, then record the conditional distribution for each
variable every N samples thereafter, then approximate the true
marginal with a mixture of the conditional distributions you've been
collecting. This should give you less noisy estimates of the marginals
than just averaging over raw posterior samples.
Of course, depending on your application getting an accurate picture
of the marginal distributions might not be as important as saving
time, in which case the question has to be settled empirically.
Especially given that it takes much longer to get a reasonable number
of effectively independent samples than it does to burn in a sampler.
Best,
Matt
