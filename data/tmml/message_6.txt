hi all,
i've been fiddling with some topic modeling and was now going to try lda. i
downloaded the lda-c package, made appropriate changes to make this compile
with the windows CL compiler (the only substantial change seemed to be
getting an implementation for lgamma, which i got from a site recommended on
this list. the other changes were minor language things).
however, when i compiled and ran the code things ran very quickly (too
quickly!) and just gave this for the likelihoods, which are obviously bogus:
0.0000000000    -1.#IND0e+000
0.0000000000    -1.#IND0e+000
0.0000000000    -1.#IND0e+000
does anyone have a set of sources that they know works for windows, or a
binary that they can point me to/send me that works? i wanted to fiddle with
the algorithm and didn't want to figure out what's going wrong in the code
on my own since it sounds like people on this list have created a binary
that works on windows.
cheers
