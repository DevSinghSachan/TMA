Hello,
Jonathan, one of gensim's users, adapted and tried the HDP method of Chong Wang et al [1] on a medical dataset. The results don't seem very promising (for a tiny comparison of LDA and HDP over the same corpus: https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/pull/73#issuecomment-3891114 ).
Any pointers of how to tweak this method, or what to expect from it in practice? Has anyone tried HDP on their corpora, so we can cross-check the results?
Cheers,
Radim
