I'm looking to meet a machine learning expert with strong topic models and NLP
skills who could help me design and test algorithms capable of revealing hidden
data structures within business contracts. I would be happy to pay at least $100
an hour (or a per project phase flat fee), and would love to speak with you if
this is of interest. I can be reached at jason at whichdraft.com or 973.457.1186.
