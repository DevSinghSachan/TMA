Dave,
Ah, I get it now!   It's like marginalizing out the finite discrete
distribution with a Dirichlet prior, to yield a Dirichlet Compound
Multinomial/Polya urn.
The Sudderth dissertation does look like a valuable intro - there doesn't
seem to be much if anything on the DP out in textbook form yet.
thanks,
Dave
