terminology -- I think when people are using the term in this context, they
mean metric in the mathematical sense (at least I did).

It really is simple...  I don't understand why so many people in academia
don't use this definition rigorously, and it kind of distrubs me how many
well educated mathematicians, statisticians, engineers and computer
scientists seem to be blissfully unware ... I digress.
My point was despite the poor off putting nomenclature KL may still be a
useful computation in some sense, but not in a statisticallly rigorous
manner such that I can use it to test a hypothesis.
