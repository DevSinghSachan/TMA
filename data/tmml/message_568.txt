Hi Lui Qui,
If you just want to use LDA-style models without digging deeper into
theory, you might want to have a look at the hierarchical bayes compiler
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hal/HBC/
It generates source code for gibbs samplers from a model specification
(*.hier file).
AFAIK it supports learning dirichlet hyperparameters (alpha/beta) [1]
and it supports the chinese restaurant process (refered to as
Pitman-Yor) you may need for estimating K [2].
Cheers,
Laura
