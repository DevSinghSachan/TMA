Dear All,
I realize there likely is not a 'clear-cut' answer to my query, but I was
hoping to get some guidance on selecting the number of latent classes
when fitting CTM/ LDA models.
The trouble is: how would i know if the model 'fit' better using 2 topics
or 20?  Since these are generative models, a fit model has an associated
likelihood.  It seems like I should be able to essentially compare
likelihoods of a model fit with 4 topics and one fit with 5 topics and make
some type of (principled) comparison.  But so far the best suggestion I have
heard is holding out data and cross-validating.  But this is
computationally infeasible for my data.
At any rate, if anyone has any thoughts or pointers on good ways of
selecting the number of 'components' in these latent models, I would greatly
appreciate it.
With thanks,
Scott Moser
