Really thank you, now I use the random initialization.
Another question is how to choose the initial alpha, it seems to me that no
matter what alpha do i choose,
it kept increasing with a constant speed in the iterations, and not
converged while the likelihood is converged,
so I strongly doubt that LDA is easy to get into a local minima as respect
to the likelihood.
The same situation happens to the LDA-C implementation.

I think the problem is the initial beta distribution is identical for each
topic. So the model is regressed to a more simple model.
