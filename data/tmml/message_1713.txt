Dear David,
Thanks for your answer. I just have some other questions.
-> I estimate the LL of the model with the left-to-right method by :
yModel.getProbEstimator().evaluateLeftToRight(testingTexts, 10 , false,
null);
I have seen in your slides
(http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/mallet-tutorial.pdf) that you choose 10 for
the "numParticles". What is the role of this feature?
-> The Log-L with this method and the perplexity of the model are the
same things ?
-> I don't obtained the same Log-L with the the left-to-right method and
the "myModel.modelLogLikelihood()". Is it normal ?
-> How can i obtaine the number of token to divide the Log-L and
evaluate my model to see if this new score is between -6 and -10 ?
-> Last question : In your paper "Topic Models Conditioned on Arbitrary
Features with,,Dirichlet-multinomial Regression" , you compare in Figure
4 the DMR and AT models. You use the EL and perplexity. Wich method did
you used to estimate this two values? (left-to-right for the EL ?
log-l/#tokens for the perplexity?)
Sorry for this huge number of questions... :D
PS : myModel is a cc.mallet.topics.ParallelTopicModel object.
Regards .
