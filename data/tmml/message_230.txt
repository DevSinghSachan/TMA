Hi Topic Model List Members,
I am a new member to this list, but have been reading it for a while now and
find it very valuable.
I have a question regarding the GaP (Gamma-Poisson) model that was
introduced by John Canny in 2004 in the article 'GaP; A factor model for
discrete data'. I am trying to implement GaP and compare its performance
with LDA. I also read an article by Nallapati et al: 'Multiscale Topic
Tomography' where they discuss the useful properties of GaP.
Has anyone ever tried to implement GaP and got similar results on the
Cranfield dataset as in Canny's article? I get the same results as him for
LDA, but not for GaP.
Overall, what is your opinion on GaP, specifically the way that Canny
implemented it (with an EM algorithm)
Kind Regards
