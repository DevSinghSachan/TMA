Dear list, Dave again
a packaged implementation of "Infinite LDA" is found at:
http://arbylon.net/projects/knowceans-ilda-20110218.zip
So far, there is no visible link -- no time to update my page now...
I've included the following stuff:
- IldaGibbs.java
- all dependent Java classes
- the NIPS corpus in svmlight format
- LdaGibbs.java, my LDA implementation for comparison between the finite and
infinite models
- introductory notes on LDA and HDP that may serve as a basis to learn about
LDA and HDP.
Be warned: All of this is somewhat hot-needle stuff but I think it may help
people get to terms with the HDP (possibly also with LDA).
I've not validated the HDP implementation quantitatively, esp. the
hyperparameter estimators need more attention.
I'd be happy to get comments on this or contributions for improvements.
Best
gregor
