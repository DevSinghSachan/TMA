yep, but even with a scalar alpha, different choices of initial alpha yields
different value of converged likelihood,
does anyone met the same problem?

I also encounter the optimization problem. I don?t know how others deals
with it. In the lda-c implementation, the alpha is treated as scalar rather
than vector to avoid the problem.  I use a low bound of the probability, try
to optimize the low bound instead and iteratively solve the alpha. For
details, please look at Estimating a Dirichlet distribution of Thomas P.
Minka 2003.
