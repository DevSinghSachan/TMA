hi tom and all,
i wouldn't call these questions "newbie" :-)
i don't know of any work where the topics are constrained to be
disjoint.  (maybe someone else does?)  however, placing a dirichlet
prior on the topic distributions with a very small parameter will
encourage the resulting topics to be sparse.  with this sparsity, the
model should prefer disjoint topics in order to explain the data.
again, i don't know of any existing work.  here at princeton,
however, we working on something along the lines of the factored
product model that you describe.  i'd be happy to trade notes about
this at some point.
all the best,
dave
