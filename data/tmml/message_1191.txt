Can anybody comment on the text data they use when working with the
Pang and Lee movie reviews dataset?  There are two possible sources
for the text data in that corpus, one is only lightly pre-processed
and contains the entire text of the reviews.  The other data has been
heavily pre-processed and consists of just the "subjective" portions
of the reviews which have been automatically identified and extracted.
Does anyone know, for example, which of these two text sources was
used for the evaluations in the sLDA paper?
Thanks in advance.
