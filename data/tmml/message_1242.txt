Hi Ayan,
Sorry, I'm afraid there isn't! (At least not one that can be
normalized analytically.) It is possible (although more complicated)
to work around this problem using the machinery of the hierarchical
Dirichlet process (HDP), however.
What's your application? I assume you don't just need to generate
random observations, since that wouldn't require conjugacy.
Best,
Matt
