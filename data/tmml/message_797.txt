Hello,
This is more of a rhetorical question. I guess I am looking for
confirmation from the members of this group.
A good way to figure out whether the LDA model is "good" for a corpus is
to compare the unigram representation of the document with the ML
representation, obtained by the LDA model. Am I right?
