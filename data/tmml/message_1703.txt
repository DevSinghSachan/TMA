Dear all,
Dynamic topic model (DTM) is originally learned in an offline way, in other
words, data in all the time epochs are used to infer the overall model. My
question is that how could I infer DTM in an incremental meaner, namely
infer parameters involved in  time epoch t by using just those in previous
time epochs at the cost of losing some accuracy.
Thanks,
Dongsheng
