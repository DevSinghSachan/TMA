Hi June,
LDA is an unsupervised model. While the topics it finds will often be
semantically interpretable as topics, there is no guarantee that the topics
it finds will match up to the topics a human would find. So, while you can
go through the topics by hand and label them with categories, you can't
expect the categories to match a pre-defined list and match them to this
list. (If you wanted to find whether there was a topic for history, say, you
could find which topics assign high probability to words such as "history",
"past", etc.)
If you want your topics to match up with previously defined topics, and your
documents are annotated in some way with their topics, you might want to
look at Labeled LDA
