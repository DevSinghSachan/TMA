When I run (after placing ap.dat in same directory as lda.exe)
./lda est 0.5 100 settings.txt ap.dat random data
I get the following
reading data from ap.dat
??? ??  7 [sig] lda 2840 c:\lda-c-dist\lda\lda.exe: *** fatal error - called with threadlist_ix -1
Hangup
Does anyone have any idea what sort of problems would cause this error?
Cheers!
