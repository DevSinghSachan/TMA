dear jiacheng,
unfortunately, the longer version of the paper is not yet ready for
distribution.  when it is, i will certainly announce it to this list.
in the past, i have used conjugate gradient for optimizing the
variational parameters for which there are no closed form solutions in
the coordinate ascent algorithm.  the gnu scientific library (GSL) has
a good implementation.
best,
dave
