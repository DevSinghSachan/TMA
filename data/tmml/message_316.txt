I provide this answer ccording to my short experience. Topic list, kindly
correct me if it is incorrect.
First, I found the technical note under
http://www.arbylon.net/publications/text-est.pdf very useful. The topic
distribution over words is learned from running the model over your data. In
order to calsulate the probability of a test document, you need to run the
model ( few iterations only) for each test document in order to get its
distribution over topics which is required to compute the perplexity.
