Hi Veena,
This is a common misunderstanding. Gamma is the parameter to a
Dirichlet distribution that approximates the posterior over the
probability simplex for the document; gamma is not the probability
simplex itself. Gamma does not have to (and generally will not) sum to
1; you can get the expected value of the probability simplex by
normalizing gamma so that it sums to one.
Best,
Matt
