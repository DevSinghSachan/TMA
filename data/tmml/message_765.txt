Hello all,
I am a freshman tring to understand topic modeling. When reading the
paper : Correlated Topic Models, one question arise in my brain:  the
multivariate gaussian variable denoted by ? is the natural parameter of
multinomial distribution, instead of the mean parameter of that.
Thanks so much.
Regards,
