Hi,
I'm working on a variational inference on HDP. Is there any open
source implementation on collapsed variational inference of HDP
available that I can use for reference? Or any suggestion about how to
estame E_q[In\Gamma(\alpha*x)] under a beta distribution with a scale
parameter \alpha?
Thanks,
Jiacheng Guo
