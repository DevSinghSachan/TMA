Hi Topic Modelers.
In this paper[1] Griffiths & Steyvers do model selection by
computing the marginal likelihood of an Gibbs-LDA model with harmonic
mean approximation.
It's known that harmonic mean estimator is very unstable and can
have infinite variance [2][3], so I find it especially surprising that
they use it successfully and moreover have error bars on their data
likelihood which are too small to print(!) ([1], Fig. 3).
In my experiments, harmonic mean seems very unreliable for LDA
marginal likelihood. Any ideas about how it was done in this PNAS paper?
Thanks and sorry of this a beginner question.
