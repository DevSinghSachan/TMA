Thank you!! Is this licensed in such a way that I could include it in
my Social Media Analytics Research Toolkit? The toolkit itself uses
the openSUSE license, which is GPL, but it includes Mallet, which uses
one of the Sun open source licenses, the Python NLTK, Perl, Ruby,
PostgreSQL and a few other open source licenses.
