Hi List,
I have some questions regarding the branching of NCRP with reference
to this earlier post by David Blei,
https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/pipermail/topic-models/2006-October/000031.html
quote:
what are the possible paths that can be drawn?  first, there is one
for each existing leaf in the tree.  then, there is a new one for
each level---a new branch can be spawned at any level from the second
down.  in total, this is the number of nodes in the currently
populated tree.  for a particular path c, when one of the levels is a
new restaurant, the quantity (C) above is 0.
I want to ask regarding this sentence "a new branch can be spawned at
any level from the second down"
May I know why is it second down and not first down?
That means we can start spawning new nodes off the root node.
