Hi,
I recently started studying topic models, so my question might be quite
trivial.
My question is about P(d|z_i) vs. P(z_i|d) where z_i is the ith topic
inferenced in a corpus
and d is a document in the corpus.
p(d|z_i) stands for the probability of document d generates the topic z_i,
and
p(z_i|d) stands for the probability of the topic belongs to the document d.
(or is this interpretation right?)
But in reality, I am not very clear about the differences between the two.
Furthermore,
I am trying to represent a document d in the k dimensional topic space for
document
clustering and other related applications. Which representation makes more
sense
between the two? In other words, d = {p(d|z_1), ..., p(d|z_k)} or d =
{p(z_1|d), ..., p(z_k|d)}
I think depending on the papers, some use the former and some use the
latter.
