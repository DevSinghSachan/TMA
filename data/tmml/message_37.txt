Oh, I see. I guess in the code, the dirichlet prior H is stored in variable
DistGlobals{}.eta... Thank you so much!
Now, I guess my real question is how to compute the conditional density of
x_{ij} (f_{k}^{x_{ji}}(x_{ij})). Since the prior of \phi_{k} is dirichlet prior
which is conjugate to the multinomial distribution,
f(x_{ij}|\phi_{k})h(\phi_{k}) is aslo dirichlet distribution of \phi_{k}. So
the marginal likelihood can be computed using the updated dirichlet parameters.
Is that right? It seems that code didn't compute the marginal likelihood
explicitly in this way. It used a multinomial sturcture... It confused me.
