Dear all,
I am following the paper "A correlated topic model of science" by Blei
and Lafferty. In the paper, the "expected Hellinger distance" between
per document topic proportion was used to measure the similarity between
documents. Could anyone kindly enlighten me on how the expected value
E{sqrt(theta_i)} could be derived and computed?
Best regards,
Kong Aik
