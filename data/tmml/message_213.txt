I know only few current Machine Learning Papers that involve stemming.
Some analyses (e.g. [1] Chapter 6.3) revealed, that depending on your
corpus, stemming may be a good or a bad thing to do.
Stemming is one approach to reduce dimensionality. LDA is another.
Although I didn't study LDA with or without stemming, I guess that you
benefit from LDA+stemming mostly for very short texts. In that case, I
would use a concatenation of unstemmed features and stemmed features, so
that LDA can be guided by the stemmed features, but may reveal subtle
semantics on the unstemmed ones.

Hope this helps,
