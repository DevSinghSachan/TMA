Thanks for the very clear explanation of the logistic normal
distribution, David.  I noticed a small bug in your R code: you need to
multiply by a square root of the covariance matrix, not the matrix
itself, to sample from a Gaussian.  The following code does this:
## zero-mean logistic normal
rlogisticnorm <- function(covariance = matrix(c(2, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 2,
0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 2), nrow=3)) {
n <- dim(covariance)[1]
covarianceChol <- chol(covariance)
result <- exp(t(covarianceChol) %*% rnorm(n))
result / sum(result)
Best,
Erik
