Dear list experts --
short question on the HDP: When formulating its test set likelihood,
would it be an acceptable simplification to interpret the current HDP
state as an LDA model of dimension K corresponding to the components
just known? This would streamline computation considerably.
Considering the augmented and direct assignment representations of the
HDP described in the JASA HDP paper, such an approach would approximate
the stick-breaking prior on topic weights (representing G_0) as a size-K
Dirichlet, from which the likelihood of the test data under phi and
theta (topic-specific word multinomials and document-specific topic
weights / G_j) can be directly derived as in LDA.
Question then is how to include hyperparameters then: Just adding their
likelihood under their (gamma etc.) priors?
Thanks
gregor
