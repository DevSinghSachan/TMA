I guess I was not clear enough. Can anyone guide me to find a dataset that
has documents gathered from multiple groups of corpus? I need something like
what was used for experimentation in dynamic topic model. If such dataset
does not exist, can anyone suggest me a way to somehow crawl this kind of
data?
Thanks,
Ayan
