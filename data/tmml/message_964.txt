Could you please let me know if there is any specific advantage of
using Gibbs sampling methods [Griffiths et al., 2004] over variational
methods [Blei et al., 2003] for the estimation of LDA (because, I have
seen that many recent implementations of LDA are based on Gibbs
sampling approach)?  I heard that VB is sensitive to initialization of
the estimation process??
Or could you point me to a paper or tech report that compares VB and
MCMC approaches to LDA estimation and how they change the LDA results
(other than the paper "On Smoothing and Inference for Topic Models" by
Asuncion et al. )
Thanks,
Clint
