Dear colleagues -- a question on sampling from a Dirichlet--multinomial distribution with a sample-dependent window.
Consider a discrete data set x_i \in [1, K] drawn from a multinomial:
x_i ~ \theta
\theta ~ Dirichlet(a)
with the usual constraints.
We additionally know that the samples are constrained to a sample-dependent window that is smaller than [1,K],
w(i, k) : N x K -> {0, 1} ,
Looking only at the data x_i, we could just use:
x_i ~ \theta'_i,k
\theta'_i,k \propto \theta_k * w(i, k)
but then the Dirichlet prior is not valid any more.
Is there some way to have a proper sampling scheme for \theta'_i,k and consequently determine the hyperparameter a ?
Maybe that's somewhere in the statistics literature but what's it called again...
Thanks
gregor
