Hi all,
These days I downloaded the CTM codes and tried to run it on my computer.
( I have redirected the link to local BLAS library). Unfortunately the
execution of program always halts on some iteration of EM. An example is
like this:
***** EM ITERATION 0 *****
doc     0   lhood -2.11049e+02   niter     5
doc     1   lhood -8.62415e+02   niter    20
doc     2   lhood -1.32725e+02   niter     5
I changed my data by removing some rows and run the CTM program
respectively, and found that sometime it went through the EM iteration 0,
but halted on iteration 1. Or it still halted on iteration 1, but can
print out different number of lines of doc.
I traced the execution of program and found it halts on a function vset()
which is implemented by calling the function gsl_vector_set() in GSl
library. I don't know what happend. Is there anybody who met the similar
problem before? Any suggestion would be appreciated!
best,
Min
