Hi, guys,
I have two questions for your help in the routine of lda_inference() in
Prof Blei's LDA c codes.
(1) In this routine, there is a sentence: var_gamma[k] =var_gamma[k] +
doc->counts[n]*(phi[n][k] - oldphi[k]);
Does it correspond to line (8) in Figure 6 or Equation (8)? Can
anyone give me some explanation on this C sentence?
(2) Which equation in Blei's JMLR paper is related to the routine
"compute_likelihood()" in the LDA c codes?
Thanks in advance.
Regards
Miaolong
