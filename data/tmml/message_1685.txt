I'm not sure how far this ended up going, but there was an interesting
project along these lines at the JHU workshop in 2010.  They were trying to
learn syntactic categories for SMT without the need of parsed data, and they
used word contexts and LDA to do it.  Each "document" was a list of contexts
that a word appeared in (one word on either side), and so "words"
corresponded to individual contexts.  Very similar to what you suggested at
the end of your post.  A little more detail (though not much - I couldn't
find any other writeup of it) can be found here:

The first session slides contain a description of what they did, starting on
page 72 of the pdf.
