Hi sir:
Because of urging to know exactly about LDA and I am a new-comer in
LDA as well, I read part of the article you listed in your Email and I have
some little questions.
1. Below the equation 2, you said "The numerator is the joint distribution
of all the random variables, which can be easily computed for any setting of
the hidden variables." Can you give me an example about that?
2. You mentioned that there are mainly two methods "Sampling and Variational
Inference " for approximating the posterior distribution. I only tried
solving the problem by the opensource code of Gibbs sampling. I am wondering
given the same dataset, will the outcomes (Beta and Theta) be the same
according to the two methods?
3. I am anxious to open the link you give about Gibss sampling "
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lda/index.html"and found it mentioned
corr-LDA code was included in it. However I downloaded the package and found
the files' postfix was rd,rds etc. Without googling what it is, I have to
ask what it means and what language it is ? I am looking forward to
accessing the code of corr-LDA.
As a new comer in LDA and not solid math background, some questions may
be very easy and really appreciating your answer.
BRs,
Shuang
