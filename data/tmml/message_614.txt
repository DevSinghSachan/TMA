Hi, all
I just started to read the paper "Latent Dirichlet Allocation",
and I have a question about express of the eq.(2) in page 996.
"the joint distribution of a topic mixture sita, a set of N topics z, and a set of N words w is given by eq.2"
I noticed that the number N is used not noly for words but also for topics.
Does it means that the number of topics equal to that of words?
Thanks a lot.
