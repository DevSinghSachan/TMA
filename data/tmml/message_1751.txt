Hi Chong,
I am interested in the full derivation of \theta_j. In the paper
you mention "We cannot derive \theta_j analytically, so we use projection
gradient". Do you have an appendix to this paper that shows the derivation
that you can share?  I see that you have mentioned that you found
comparable performance using theta from vanilla LDA, but my application is
different and I expect significant benefit from actually utilizing the CTR
derivation for theta.
