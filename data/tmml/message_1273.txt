Hello Ayan:
Dirichlet distrbution is a member of the exponential family (Example 3.3.4
in The Bayesian Choice, 2004) therefore "enjoy" conjugate priors. It is
however a non-standard type of distribution over R^p with (p+1) parameters,
as illustrated in the special case of the Beta distribution just before
Example 3.3.15 in The Bayesian Choice (2004, p.122) [from the comments
section of Professor Gelman's blog -- Professor Christian Robert].
But it is more intuitive to use Professor Gelman's solution in this blog

In case you are interested in similar algorithms, there is another comment
relating to that.
Thanks and Best Regards,
S.
