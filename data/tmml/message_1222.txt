CALL FOR PAPERS
In the real-time Web, the latest evolution of the Web, information is
generated very quickly, consumed by millions of users, and updated
rapidly by others through commenting, replying, transferring, etc.
This is practiced by people who differ in culture, knowledge,
background, ideology. Moreover, information generally comes from
several channels and is sent out to different ones. This is amplified
by the social networking phenomenon -- the social Web, which is
nowadays a well established set of technologies, based on which users
and service providers can exchange messages through an interaction
network, share information and collaborate, advertise a product,
create communities and influence them, etc. Besides, there is an
abundant literature regarding the different aspects of social networks
be it their construction or the detection of nodes playing specific
roles.
However, there is currently no clear understanding of the laws
governing these social networks, in particular how they evolve over
time. Thus, it is difficult to draw a clear image linking the existing
models of social networks and the real underlying social mechanisms.
As a result, there is a big gap in concertizing and evaluating most of
the research efforts in this area. Furthermore, due to the growing
complexity of digital social networks and the huge quantity of new
data available everyday, it becomes crucial for the researchers to
provide a clear understanding of the dynamics of these networks. It
also becomes important for the community to not only understand what
is happening currently in the network but also to predict the next
evolution and monitor the trends in the network. In order to be
efficient in analyzing these networks, it is important to be able to
predict the dynamics in its different forms: the content evolution
(i.e., hot topics evolution), network structure (e.g., creation of new
relations), information diffusion, influence evolution, etc.
To address the above mentioned aspects of social network dynamics, we
solicit the following topics (but not limited to):
- Information diffusion in social networks;
- Community extraction, analysis, and evolution;
- Detection of (possibly evolving) roles;
- Content evolution and tracking in social networks;
- Social media recommendations;
- Information quality and evolution in social content;
- Security and privacy in rapidly evolving social networks;
- Evaluation techniques and benchmarks;
- New challenges in mining social networks;
- Example studies and use cases of dynamics of social networks;
