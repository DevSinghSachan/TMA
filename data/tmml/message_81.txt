Hi All,
I managed to run the topic estimation on my document collection. Now, I want to run Inference on my collection, I run the following command:
./lda inf settings.txt [model] mydata [name]
There are two parameters in this command , model and name which I dont know how should I set them, is model parameter a file name? what is "name"?
Also, I want to see the topics assigned to each word, for the following command:
python topics.py <beta file> <vocab file> <n words>
I am not sure which beta file I should use (there are 1000, also what is the vocabulary file and words?
Thanks in advance
