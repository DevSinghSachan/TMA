hi all,
yes, each row is log p(w | z) for a particular topic.
lda-c produces \gamma_d, which are dirichlet parameters that
approximate the posterior distribution of \theta given the dth
document, p(\theta | w_1,d, ..., w_N,d).  (in its exact form, this
posterior is not in the dirichlet family.)
see the paper "latent dirichlet allocation" from JMLR for details.
as you suggest, one estimate of \theta is E[\theta | \gamma], which
are the normalized values.
best,
dave
