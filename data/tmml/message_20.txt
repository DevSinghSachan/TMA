Hello list,
I'm trying to implement a "model quality" indicator for the LDA model.
Any ideas? I haven't really understood well how the perplexity was
calculated in Blei's paper, I thought of calculating that, but haven't
found a solution yet. Also, I'm working on a generalization of the LDA
model for hierarchical data (in my case, administrative procedures that
are somehow "generated" by the laws they're referring to), so it would
make sense to compare both models and - but would be far beyond my hopes
- perhaps even approximate the optimal number of topics.
Any ideas?
By the way, I should also compare LDA with LSI, but I guess citing
previous studies will work just fine in my master's thesis, as I think
the precision/recall graphs are the only way to go. :)
Best regards,
Matteo Dimai
