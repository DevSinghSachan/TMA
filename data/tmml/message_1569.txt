I believe all that needs to be done then is to
a.) Map your documents int o a
space which is the union of the visual words and annotations.   If your visual
vocabulary is of size N and your annotation vocabulary is of size M, then you
can do this by mapping vocabulary items 0:(N-1) to visual words and N:(M+N-1)
to annotation words.   Each document is now just a bag of words from both
vocabularies.
b.) For the vocab parameter of lda.collapsed.gibbs.sampler,
instead of passing a single vector of vocabulary terms, pass in a list of
length two; the first should be the vocabulary vector for visual words and the
second the vocabulary vector for annotation words.
