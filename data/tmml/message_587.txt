hi, all
i just released the code for supervised topic models for
classification at http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chongw/slda/index.html
it still needs some polishing, such as the speed for E-step , hope i
have time to do that in the near future.
If you find any bugs, please kindly notify me.
thanks and have a nice summer!
best
chong
