Dear all,
As the graphical models have been applying to several fields, people began to  design the specific graphical models for the particular applications. Therefore, I have two questions, i.e., How to design the graphical models? And how to estimate the parameters for the designed graphical models?
Can anybody help me and recommand some papers?
Best regards,
Wang Luo
