They will not be equivalent. The author-topic model is structured so
that authorship information changes the way that topics are learned
and assigned to documents. Doing as you suggest would not allow the
model to use this information when fitting topics. In general, when
you fit the components of a complex model separately you cannot expect
to get equivalent results to those you would have gotten by fitting
them jointly.
