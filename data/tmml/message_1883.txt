Hi,
I am studying Hierarichial LDA. As far I understand is that, as the
documents are submitted to hLDA, it generates term-frequency count of each
document and then considered each words as data points and then do the
clustering to generate the topics and then we have to arrange these topics
in hierarchy, how this topics are arranging in hierarchy, what mathematics
are used to do that?
Thanks
