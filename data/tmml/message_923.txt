Hi David,
Thanks for explanation -- it was very informative. However, according to
your description, DiscLDA appears to me to be a conditional model for labels
as well, since the label appears to be "upstream" to the  topic
assignments, according to its generative process. Hence only sLDA appears to
be truly generative for labels. Please correct me if I am wrong.
Another important point I would like to point out is that only Labeled LDA
(and perhaps the DMR model in less obvious ways) models multiple labels per
document explicitly. To the best of my understanding, both Supervised LDA
and DiscLDA assume a single label for each document, at least as published.
Azeem seemed to be more interested in this scenario of multiple labels per
documents, for which I believe Labeled LDA is quite appropriate,
notwithstanding the theoretical differences between conditional and
generative models. Besides in our experiments, we found that Labeled-LDA is
quite competitive with multiple one-vs-rest SVMs trained on word-TF-IDF
features. Hence, as a debugging step, I would run the SVMs first and see if
the Labeled-LDA performance differs markedly from them. One clear advantage
of Labeled LDA compared with the SVM classifiers is that the former can tell
what passages of the document are assigned to what topics, while the latter
does not model it explicitly.
Thanks
