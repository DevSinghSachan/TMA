Hi,
I am trying to run hlda-c code. I got the executable main and run the
command - "./main gibbs corpus settings out" and got a folder run000 as
output which is attached in mail.
After this, the next command to run is- "./main heldout train test settings
out". I am using corpus1 as train, corpus2 as test but i dont know what to
use as settings, please can anyone tell that whatever I am doing is right
and what to use as settings. All documents are attached.
Thank you
