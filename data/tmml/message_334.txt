Dave,
Arindam Banerjee and I had a paper where we studied online versions of LDA
and a couple of other topic models -- mixture of vMF distributions and the
DCM model. That may be useful for you:

Note that the online inference we used for LDA in this paper was an
efficient heuristic based on MAP estimates, not the true online Bayesian
update.
Best,
Sugato.
