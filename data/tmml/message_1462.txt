Hi All,
I'm new to LDA, but I thought someone here might know the answer to this.
Lets say we have two words:
"business"
"hockey"
Lets assume that both words in the corpus are of relatively similar
frequency.  However, that hockey seems to be a more specific word than the
general business one.  Thereby, business would then occur presumably in many
more topics than hockey?
Also, then there is the problem of:
"bush" -- the word might have two meanings, one being George Bush, and the
other most common one might be the shrub.  However, in thier specific topic
areas, they might not be that general.  They are merely ambigious forms.
This is different than a word like business which might not be in any
particular set of related topics, but perhaps scattered everywhere.  Of
course, the exact examples I've chosen here are probably not the best
choices, but hopefully you get the idea.
If one was wanting to score a word based on it's generality, is there any
good measure or formula for doing so?  For example, find me the most common
words and rank them from most specific to most general?
Thanks, Ian
