Hi, everyone
Dirichlet Process and its extensions like full hierarchical approaches
based on DP are useful tools for
modeling.
Because sampling based inference method on infinite mixtures is cost,
some variational methods are proposed such as Truncated DP in
"Gibbs sampling methods for stick-breaking priors" and
Dirichlet-multinomial allocation(DMA) in
"Dirichlet Enhanced Latent Semantic Analysis".
In these methods, finite mixture is used to approximate the DP.
However, In the above papers, only one DP is applied in the model to
sample distributions.
I want to know for those models with DPs arranged according to any tree
structure, like the model "M3" on page 20 in
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/papers/hdp.pdf, can we use
finite mixtures at all levels to approximate the inference?
What kinds of impact might the method result in ?
Thanks
Peng
