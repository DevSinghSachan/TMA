Hi,
Does anyone know of an implementation (matlab/c/c++) of the supervised
variant of LDA as proposed in
"A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Learning Natural Scene Categories"
(http://vision.stanford.edu/documents/Fei-FeiPerona2005.pdf),
where a variable for the scene type is introduced on top of the topic
multinomial (not sLDA).
Regards,
Nikhil
