hi -- there's nothing nearly as easy as fast+easy as Ipe:
http://tclab.kaist.ac.kr/ipe/
Before that, I tried powerpoint, latex + pstricks and jPicEdt. Don't expect a
fully-featured vector graphics package like Inkscape, but for schematics it's
all there. What I also liked about it is that Ipe uses PDF metadata to store
sources in PDFs that you may directly use with \includegraphics{}. And you can
express almost everything in Ipe's text boxes using most of your favourite latex
packages.
