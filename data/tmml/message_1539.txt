Good morning.
Unfortunately the answer is no.
Gibbs gives you no guarantees about the convergence of the values of
specific variables.  You only have guarantees about convergence in
distribution.  In practice, distributions seem to settle down after a few
(approx. 1000) iterations.  Diagnosing convergence of Gibbs samplers in our
discrete models is still an open problem.
