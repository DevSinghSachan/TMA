in the continuing story of naming issues and topic modeling,
hierarchical latent dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical
dirichlet process are different models (though related).
hierarchical LDA uses "hierarchical" to indicate a tree of topics at
different levels of abstraction; the hierarchical DP uses
"hierarchical" to indicate multiple levels of random variables in a
bayesian hierarchical model.
laura was (correctly) pointing you to the HDP.  i think you'll want to
use yee whye's code.
