Let me expand on this suggestion.
Summary:   The Dirichlet(\rho*\vec\theta) distribution
can be approximated by the DirichletProcess(\rho,\vec\theta)
distribution which is *almost* conjugate to itself.
This is what the Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes
are all about.  Methods for this are an active area of research.
When applied to a probability vector \vec\theta,
the Dirichlet Process approximates the Dirichlet distribution.
That is:
Dirichlet(\rho*\vec\theta)
is approximated by
DirichletProcess(\rho,\vec\theta)
In fact the two distribution have identical 1st, 2nd and 3rd order moments.
The details are in our review article on the Pitman Yor Process:
A Bayesian Review of the Poisson-Dirichlet Process

The Dirichlet Process, when applied to finite probability vectors,
is *almost* conjugate to itself.  Almost, because while you can integrate
out the vector \vec\theta, you have to replace it with
so-called table counts.  The relevant result appears in
Corollary 17 of Buntine and Hutter.
Thus one can do all sorts of tricks with hierarchical Dirichlets
implemented as hierarchical Dirichlet Processes or Hierarchical Pitman Yor's.
Some examples of this are in recent papers by Lan Du and co-authors.

We're get exceptional results applying this to a range of LDA variants.
