Hi all,
I am trying to deal with short document using LDA?and there are two
questions:
1. I just want to know which tool is better between Gibbs LDA and
varational LDA for dealing with short document,  and why?
2. Is there any method by LDA inference from the perspective of semantic
view to evaluate if one recognized result in form of text is wrong because
of some misrecognized words after recognition is completed? and How?
Thanks in advance!
