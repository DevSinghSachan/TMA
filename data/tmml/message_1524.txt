hi topic models list,
last month i emailed about allison chaney's topic modeling browser.
we're working on improving it and were hoping for your help.
if you are inclined, can you spend 15m browsing on allison's wikipedia
browser?  it can be found here:
http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/ajb/tmve/wiki100k/browse/topic-list.html
and please email her (cc'ed) your thoughts.  we are particularly interested in:
(a) what did you learn about the model fit from browsing?
(b) what did you learn about wikipedia from browsing?
(c) what kinds of issues / problems did you see?
thanks!
best
dave
