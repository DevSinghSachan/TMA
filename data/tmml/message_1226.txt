Alta --
See Alex Smola's Blog:
the Mozilla Public License. It?s seriously fast and scales very well to
1000 machines or more (don?t worry, it runs on a single machine, too). We
believe that at present this is the fastest implementation you can find, in
particular if you want to have a) 1000s of topics, b) a large dictionary,
c) a large number of documents, and d) Gibbs sampling. It handles quite
comfortably a billion documents. Shravan Narayanamurthy deserves all the
credit for the code. The paper describing an earlier version of the system
appeared in VLDB 2010<http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vldb2010/pvldb_vol3/R63.pdf>.
