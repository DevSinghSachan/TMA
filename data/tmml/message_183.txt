Hello.  I'm a graduate student in computer science at UT Austin,
focusing on natural language processing.  I'm doing a project where
I'm planning on implementing a supervised LDA model and comparing
it to an existing paper where a standard, unsupervised LDA model is
used, to see how much gain comes in this case from using data labels
when they're available.  The thing is, however, that the "response variable"
(the data label) is categorical (multi-category) rather than being a real number
or numerical scale or anything like that.  Section 2.3 of Blei and
McAuliffe's "Supervised Topic Models" paper says that this can be done
using generalized linear models -- in this case, presumably using logistic
regression instead of linear regression.  However, it isn't described
exactly how to do this, and I'm not familiar enough with variational
methods to be able to figure this out on my own without a fair amount
of difficulty.
Could anyone out there help me with this?
The most basic thing I need help with is some info (update equations and
such) on how to modify the variational E and M steps when the response
variable is a multi-value categorical variable rather than a real number.
However, if this ends up being too hard, the appropriate equations for a
binary response variable / logistic link function would be useful, too.
Also super great would be any code that anyone has that implements
supervised LDA, even if it's in rough shape.
Thanks!
Ben Wing
