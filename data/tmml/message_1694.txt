Hi Dan,
I've been working with a JSTOR DFR corpus recently. (I've used LDA
through the topicmodels R package, which calls GibbsLDA++.)
I do have one idea about (part of) your problem. The LDA implementations
you refer to are very different. MALLET uses Gibbs sampling and (I
think) it uses an asymmetric prior specification described in
"Rethinking LDA: Why Priors Matter" by Hanna Wallach et al. The original
LDA C code doesn't use Gibbs. (And the software that does use Gibbs
tends to use symmetric priors on the two Dirichlets.) I'm not surprised
the results differ.
Best,
Allen
