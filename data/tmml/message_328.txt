Hi Min,
I have this problem on an older Intel machine running Ubuntu Gutsy.
Unfortunately I have not been able to solve it, but believe it does
have to do with GSL. I have a newer Intel machine running Ubuntu Gutsy
as well and have no problems running the CTM code on it. Both
computers have identical GSL package installations. What is your
setup? Does anyone know if this could somehow be hardware related?
Best,
-Corey
