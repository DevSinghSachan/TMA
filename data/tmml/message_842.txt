Toyin,
There's been some work in this area.  This paper by Wang, Ma, and Grimson
proposes two models, based on LDA and HDP, respectively, to address activity
modeling. I found it well written, informative, and thorough.

And here's a more recent paper by Wang and Carin that proposes a temporally
and spatially dependent topic model for activity perception (this is my
work)

Both papers use quantized Lucas-Kanade optical flow fields to describe
"visual words" that then are analyzed by the proposed topic models.
Hope this helps.
