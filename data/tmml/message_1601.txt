Dear All,
given a list of keywords for each topic k (in K) i want to force those
keywords to be contained by the topics k i have defined. All other /
unknown Words should align according to the optimal distribution after
Gibbs Sampling as normal.
topic 1: Word 1, Word 2
topic n: ..., Word n
Somehow i like to Bias the Gibbs Sampler by such a list. Does anyone has
had expirience with such a problem.
My guess is to either to
1. Bias the sampler by aligning the ? parameters for each word. Bias it
for the topic - word combination given by my definition. This still
leaves the possibility that the sampler is aligning to the data and
excludes defined words if they do not fit alright.
or
2. Just Force the gibbs sampler to align a topic by inserting the list
into the sampler. In this case the sampler would just mix up the
semantics of the topics if there where "stronger" more "discriminant"
words for the different topics in the corpus.
Any thougts and tipps are welcome
Thanks
