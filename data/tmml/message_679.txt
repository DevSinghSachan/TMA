Liviu,
as the largest word index influences the dimensionality of your
multinomial vector, you want to keep the word indices as low as
possible. Thus, you build up the word dictionary yourself. Go through
the text and hash the words, then replace you documents by a sequence of
indices.
Hope this helps,
Laura
