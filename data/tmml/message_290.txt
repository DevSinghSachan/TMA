dear wim,
you are correct.  z and w are indicator vectors with a single 1 in them.
z_n does not appear because it has been marginalized out.  its
probability is p(z) = \theta_i.  we supress the usual \prod_i
(blah)^{z^i} notation there since we are guaranteed that each
(blah)^{z^i} will appear exactly once.  (you can marginalize z
yourself from equation 2 to confirm this.)
this is correct.
best,
dave
