Even I have similar doubts. By doing so, we are infact altering the model
altogether. However, the variational inference theory tells like that. I am
also searching a justification for that.
See, here I have a doubt as to your undertsadning of the word 'inference'. I
feel that you are referring to the word in the context of infering some
results from the model for the unseen examples. Is that true? What ever the
'inference', paper mentios is part of model building it self.
