Dear modellers,
I was wondering about structured text. As you know, plenty abound and
perhaps structure could be exploited (at least for specific
applications).
One example of this is Mimno's approach by modelling book chapters
independently from each other and then merging them together.
Is there a model that integrates structure as well as text? Does it make
sense to have one? How would such model behave on short texts, i.e.
papers structured as {intro, background, proposal, experiment,
conclusions} and only 8 pages?
Cheers,
