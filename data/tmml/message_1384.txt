Dear Charles, list,
Thanks for this hint.  Indeed, the JIT compiler does a fair bit of run-time
optimisation, as can easily be checked using the -Xint flag when starting the JVM.
Regarding the question about debugging: What definitely helps in Java, is Sun's
VisualVM profiler, which seems to have missed to get the airplay it deserves:

This tool allows you to watch and analyse running threads in real-time. In C,
somewhat more intricate to use but similarly effective, is the trio gdb, gprof
and valgrind.
ps -- also thanks to Mateusz Beresecki for a hint on caching.
Best regards
gregor
