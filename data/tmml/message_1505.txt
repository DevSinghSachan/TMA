Lda may find that two topics have an equal share in a document. Say theta(t1)=0.5 and theta(t2)=0.5  How would you pick the largest then?
Even if theta(t1)=0.51 and theta(t2)=0.49 would you really want the document to be associated only with the cluster of t1?
Lda rather gives you a soft clustering.
And I think that is a good thing.
You may rethink whether lda is the right model for your purposes. Maybe you would like to learn a different model that associates each document with only a single topic rather than a mixture over topics.
