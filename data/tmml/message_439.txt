Hi Gregor, I didn't understand your first question, the derivation of
eq.14 was in the email that you replied to.  As for the second
observation about getting to good optimum then deviating from it, I
hadn't seen behaviour like this.  shouldn't collapsed variational
always improve on the free energy (up to small perturbations due to
the gaussian approximation) at each iteration? -yw
