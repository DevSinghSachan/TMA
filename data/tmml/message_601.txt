hi all,
I'm using another tool of LDA----GibbsLDA++ , which offer the some useful
information in the files of theta and phi:
theta: p(topic|document)
phi:    p(word|topic)
So, my question is about posterior probability calculation:
after estimation, given the files of theta and phi, the way I use to
calculate the posterior probability p(topic|word) is:
p(topic|word) = p(word|topic)*p(topic)/p(word)
In which, p(word|topic) is supplied in the phi file, the other factors is
calculated as:
for the ith topic, p(topic_i)= SUM_j[p(topic_i|document_j)*p(document_j) ]
for the ith word, p(word_i)= SUM_j[p(word_i|topic_j)*p(topic_j) ]
in which, p(topic|document) can be found in theta, and p(word|topic) can be
found in phi.
so, is it a right way to calculate the posterior probability?
