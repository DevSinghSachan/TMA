Hi Harry,
There has been some work on music tastes using topic modeling:
Modeling Shared Tastes in Online Communitites
Laura Dietz
I am sure there is more -- i just did a quick search in my files...
that is a cool correspondence !
If you like Lil Wayne then I you are probably so far gone in the mainsteam
crap, that you wouldn't appreciate the classiscs ;)
LDA works on any data, so I don't see an obstacle for this working,
just to be clear your mean this right:
doc = user
topic = set of artists = genre
word = artist
What will be the equivalent of your "word counts for doc" Nwd  ?
Song play counts by a certain artist?
Number of songs in library by certain artist?
If you have data for couple of thousand users and a 50/100
fav. artists for each user LDA should be able to find some very cool "genres".
