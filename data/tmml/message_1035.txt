Dear all (Specically to Mr Charles Elkan)
I am curious to know how the Dirichlet compound multinomial(DCM) is able to
handle the burstiness nature of text documents? Because the following paper
tells that the DCM is able to consider the burstiness.
C. Elkan. Deriving TF-IDF as a Fisher kernel. International Symposium on
String Processing and Information Retrieval (SPIRE'05).

I am not able to visualize this. Please tell me in detail.
I am even reading the paper:
G. Doyle and C. Elkan. Accounting for Word Burstiness in Topic Models. ICML
2009.
http://www.machinelearning.org/archive/icml2009/papers/162.pdf
Still not getting that visualization. Please help me in this regards
