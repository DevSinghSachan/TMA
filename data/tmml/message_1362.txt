Hello Everyone,
I am learning to use topic modeling for documents clustering. I would like
to clarify whether my understaning of the relationship between latent
dirichlet allocation (LDA) and the generic task of document clustering is
correct or not?
The LDA analysis tends to output the topic proportions for each document.
This is not the direct result of document clustering. However, we can treat
this probability proportions as a feature reprsentation for each document.
Afterwards, we can invoke other established clustering method, like K-means,
to cluster documents based on the feature configurations generated by LDA
analysis.
Thanks a lot.
