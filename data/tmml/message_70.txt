hey YW,
i hope all is well in london.
actually, i meant assuming a fully factorized variational
distribution on theta and z, optimizing with respect to the
variational parameters of theta, and then folding those updates into
the bound.  i.e.,
1. q(z, \theta) = q(z) q(\theta) where q(z) is factorized and q
(\theta) is a dirichlet
2. optimize the uncollapsed bound w/r/t to q(\theta)
3. fold that optimization into the bound and optimize w/r/t q(z) as i
laid out earlier.
rather than
q(z, \theta) = q(z) q(\theta | z)
as you assume to get CVI.
that's very interesting.  i'd think that the second term (with the
variance) would bring the approximation down too, but i guess not if
the variance is small.
i meant the uncollapsed variational bound evaluated at the CVI
solution versus the same bound evaluated at a VB solution.  i suspect
that it is better and, as you suggested, that CVI gets us to a better
local minimum.  (i'll try this out...)
best,
dave
