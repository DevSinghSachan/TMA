Dear Michael,
Here http://www.mad.disco.unimib.it/doku.php/research/corpora  you can
find a not updated list of some of the corpora used in papers
regarding topic models.
While doing my phd, I also created a corpus  composed by 50k documents
randomly downloaded from the web. The documents have been found by
submitting to Google several queries composed by terms available in
the Google Directory (now dmoz).
I think one of the difficulties in the topic models fields is to find
a "baseline" dataset to use as a benchmark :)
Best,
Davide Magatti
