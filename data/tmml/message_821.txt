hi dave
the connection between the CRP and the DP is as follows.
suppose
G ~ DP(a G0)
x_i ~ G, i = 1...n
now consider the joint distribution p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n | a, G0).
notice, we have marginalized out G, the distribution drawn from a DP.
the joint distribution of the x's will exhibit a partition structure
whereby sets of x's take on precisely the same value.  the unique
values in the x's are independent draws from G0.  the distribution of
the partition structure is given by the CRP.
i hope this helps.  for a readable introduction to this circle of
ideas, i recommend the early chapters of erik sudderth's phd
dissertation.
all the best
dave
