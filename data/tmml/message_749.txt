I've been working with Twitter data for quite a while now. Here are
some "tricks of the trade."
1. If you can, get your Twitter data from the Streaming or REST APIs,
not from the Search API. The Search API strips out a *lot* of metadata!
2. Metadata is your friend! For example, in many API calls, you can
request what Twitter calls "entities". These are separate fields
within the tweet text, already parsed out for you. Entities are
hashtags, mentions (screen names with an "@" in front), and links.
These are part of the semantics of tweets as a language.
3. Depending on what you're trying to do, it is sometimes useful to
concatenate the text of multiple tweets by the same sender into a
single "document" for analysis. There may be some people who have done
"author-document-topic" models where each document is a single tweet,
but I'm guessing that might be difficult.
