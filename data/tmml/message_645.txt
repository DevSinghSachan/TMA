Hi,
I guess that this file is a p(z|theta_d)  , where z is a sub-topic
What mathematical procedure is hidden behind this file?
You can find the variational inference algorithm on page 1005 Figure 6. of
the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei) paper. The intuition is that for each
document you are trying to find the variational posteriors which tell you
the topic "mixture" of each document. So, the final.gamma file is the output
of the posterior Dirichlet topic mixture for all documents. You'll notice
that the number of lines in the file is the number of documents.
For inference, you get a similar file that you got for the estimation step,
ie, variational Dirichlets for each document.
