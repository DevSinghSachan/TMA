I am interested in Dirichlet compound multinomial hypothesis testing (rather
than a numerical approach).
Such as for a Polya Urn Representation, where by I want to conclude that a
sequences of draws was from generated from one set of alpha parameters
rather than another with a certain rankable probability.  In a corpus terms
I want calculate the probability that one set of words or query was
distinctly drawn from one of two documents.  The only way I can see to do
this is to calculate the overlap in the two distributions of a dirichlet
compound multinomial.  I have no reason to believe that the two
distributions are the same, but they could be.
I keep trying to solve for the overlap of the two distributions, however on
the simplex this is quite difficult especially since the integrals involve
absolute values.  The dirichlet multinomial integral has been integrated
before, and I can integrate simple variations of this equation.
I wonder if there have been any efforts to integrate dirichlet multinomial
type distributions, and or any hypothesis testing over such integrals.
Is there any calculus theory for which I can read and learn to integrate
these types of integrals
Thanks,
Robin Kramer
