Neal,
I was just thinking about this yesterday.  Before I would have gasped at
using KL since it is definitely not a metric due to its non-symmetry.  I
think the term metric is a poor choice of terminology since in some
disciplines a metric is very well defined.  Furthermore my Computer Vision
and Artificial Intelligence professors did little to present why one would
be inclined to believe that the an overlap in one distribution was more
probable than another, however from a dirichlet perspective it does make
some sense.   The key point is that the overlap of two documents is the
same, but the content in the non overlapping was much larger in one document
than the other; subtracting the smaller document from the larger document
will have less of an effect on the distribution than subtracting the larger
