Hi all,
Is there a paper that specifically introduces Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
LDA?    I know it's presented in "Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes" by Teh
et al, along with lots of other HDP-related topics, but is there a specific
HDP-LDA work one can consult/reference?   (Note I'm talking here about the
"flat" infinite topic model, not hLDA.)
thanks,
Dave
