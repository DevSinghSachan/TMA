In support of Dave's suggestion, I have a MapReduce implementation of
the AD-LDA algorithm; it works well in hundreds of our experiments
using blog data, scientific paper data, music lyric data, social
network data and annotated image data.
The experiments show that if the communication cost can be further
reduced, the scalability would be better.  When we have thousands of
computers, I do not care too much on the computing time, but the
scalability (speedup) does matter.
