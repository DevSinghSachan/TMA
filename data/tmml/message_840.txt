Hello All,
I joined this list today after reading David Blei's paper on Topic models.
I want to apply this concept to video, for modelling different types of human activity.
I have been able to extract spatio-temporal features in terms of 'visual words' which represents each video clip?as a distribution over these code words.
Now I want to apply HDP to this dataset to build a generative model that captures the structure in each class of activity.
My goal is for the model to be able to corectly classify an unseen data into one of the identified classes, and to detect an abnormal activity.
Does anyone have suggestions on how I can go about this?
I will be grateful.
Toyin
