Hi Vasiliy -- you can use NIPS and get good topics if you exclude "network" etc. as domain-specific stop words, for instance for document frequency > corpussize / 4. Examples for topics that a topic model then creates:
- dendritic synaptic voltage membrane conductance channels neuron
- orientation cortical dominance ocular cortex development lateral eye cells visual
- rbf classifier classifiers radial decision centers lippmann mlp regions knn
- ica source separation sources blind mixing signals amari entropy bell
- posterior carlo monte bayesian covariance prior sampling variance mackay
- kernel support svm kernels vapnik machines regression regularization margin sv
(Example from a variant model, lda will be analogous)
Other useful pointers are: ACL Anthology, AP data (also used in Dave Blei's lda-c code) and those reported in papers...
