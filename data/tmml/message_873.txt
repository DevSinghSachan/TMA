Hi All,
I want to use LDA as base model for web 2.0 content analysis.
I am searching for some objective method to decide the values for hyper
parameters (i.e. alpha & beta) and deciding the number of topics for the
collection.
Second thing is, if there is a way to decide objectively about the quality
of topics discovered by LDA?
My third question is related to compute the distance between topics, which
one is a good measure for this, JS divergence or KL divergence ? or some
other measure ...
thanks a lot in advance,
