Dear All,
I am a little confused about the "Smoothing" part in the paper "Latent
Dirichlet Allocation" JMLR 2003. Is there any code that has implemented the
smoothing function? Is there any paper or technical report that explicitely
show how the parameters are updated in the E-step for the smoothing lda?
Thank you for your help.
Best
