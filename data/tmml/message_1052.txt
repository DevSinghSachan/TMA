Hello List Members,
Could someone pls help me with a suggestion on the format for input data for the LDA and HDP codes.
-I am processing video data but using the topic modeling concept for word documents.
Each video clip (document) is represented as a histogram of word frequencies.
Each row m(i) represents a document, and each column n(j) represent the different words.
Each cell (i,j) contains the frequency of occurrence of word j in document i.
I then tried to use this in the topic discovery mode HDP.
