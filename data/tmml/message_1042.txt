dear veena
the name "latent dirichlet allocation" was one of several candidates that
andrew ng, mike jordan and i were considering.  (i can't remember the
others.  this was in the early summer of 2001.)
here is the idea behind the name.  theta is a per-document dirichlet random
variable, and it is latent.  in the generative process, we draw z_n from
mult(theta) and then draw each word from the corresponding topic
distribution.  in this way, theta is used to parameterize the allocation of
observed words to topic indicators.
