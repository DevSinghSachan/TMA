Hi sonfon,
Thanks for the bug report! There was a problem in the command line
interface for the MALLET parallel topic model sampler. It's now fixed in
the public mercurial repository (see http://mallet.cs.umass.edu for
details).
MALLET support questions can also go to mallet-dev at cs.umass.edu, but we
don't mind the publicity for our topic modeling package!
