Hi,
Can we not take the concept from Topic link LDA (
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~icml2009/papers/379.pdf) where we model the
coauthors in the form of a graph. I tried doing this on social media but am
implementing the RART model and would like to know if any one has tried it.
Sincerely
Tanmoy Mukherjee
