Folks,
Suppose I put together a large document corpus and ran estimation on
it to create the model. I understand that I can now run inference on
new documents but is there a way to use new documents to "refresh"
the model? Is re-estimating the original corpus plus new documents
the only way to go?
Thanks, Joel
