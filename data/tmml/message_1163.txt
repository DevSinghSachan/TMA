Hi JR,
In my understanding, the idea of LDA is that you just end up with the mixtures of topics, which can be viewed as a sort of soft classifier. If you are looking for a hard classification into one of a fixed number of classes, you could try a different topic model.
In your case, the single author-topic model [1] could be suitable. I have no experience in using it, but as I understand it each document is assumed to be written by a single author, and each author corresponds to a different multinomial distribution over topics.
In your case, 'author' would correspond to 'supercategory', such as medicine or economics, and associated with each of these there would be a distribution over topics. So 'medicine' might have 30% pharmacology, 20% surgery, 10% virology etc., and associated with each of these topics would be a multinomial distribution over words (as in LDA). Each document would then be classified as just one single supercategory (author).
Thanks,
Michael
