Hi,
For two corpora where each document in them employ the same vocabulary
as the feature vector, how could we make the meaning of the learned
topics consistent?
If we estimate the parameters of one corpus first and employ these
parameters as the prior for the estimation of next corpus, are the
meaning of topics exactly same?
Regards,
Peng
