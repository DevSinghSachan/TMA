Using EM to learn alpha and beta values is an idea that works.  Gibbs
sampling can be used for the E step within EM.  For some details see the
ICML 2009 paper "Accounting for Word Burstiness in Topic Models" by Doyle
and Elkan, available at http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~elkan/TopicBurstiness.pdf
Other earlier papers with similar EM/Gibbs methods do exist.  Perhaps
their authors can provide pointers.
Best wishes, Charles Elkan
