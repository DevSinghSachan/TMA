Hi all, I have a question about a specific prior for a Dirichlet distribution...
First, I must make a reference to Hierarchical Dirichlet Process in order to describe what I want to achieve with Dirichet Distribution with a fixed number of dimensions... In hierarchical DP, we can model Phi1 ~ DP(H,g), where H is a base distribution for first DP defined on sigma-algebra over set Omega, and then let Phi2 ~ DP(Phi1,g2). In this way, Phi1 and Phi2 will share the same atoms from the sigma-algebra over Omega. Depending on parameter g2, the draws from Phi2 will be modifications of draws from Phi1, so that Phi2 will produce modified probabilities on the same atoms as Phi1.
Now, I want to do this with a finite number of components. Let Xi1 ~ Dirichlet(g1). Now I want to have Xi2 distributed in such a way that it is a "modification" of probabilities originally produced by Xi1. Of course, Xi1 and Xi2 should have the same dimensionality. For example, let's say we have dimensionality of 3. A draw from Xi1 could be (.70, 0.25, .05). Then I want a draw from Xi2 to use Xi1 as prior and produce draws that approximately correspond to the draw from Xi1 (perhaps guided by some parameter that can regulate how much the draws can deviate from the prior). For example, draws from Xi2 could produce (.71, .24, .05), (.68, .26, .06), etc.
So the question is whether I can do that, and how, and if there is a well defined way of doing it already, some papers/books for reference etc? For example, can I just feed a draw from Xi1, perhaps multiplied by a scalar parameter g, as a multidimensional parameter for the Dirichlet distribution of Xi2? Can anyone please point me toward and papers doing something similar?
I am also interested whether this kind of prior will constitute a conjugate prior, so I can eventually devise a Gibbs sampling algorithm for inferring the model parameters...
Thank you in advance,
Andrey
