There's a ton of work on Twitter coming out in various forums this year,
some of it uses topic model style approaches.
For instance, this work is in NAACL 2010:
"Unsupervised Modeling of Twitter Conversations"
Alan Ritter, Colin Cherry, Bill Dolan
To appear in proceedings of HLT-NAACL 2010

And I'll be presenting this at ICWSM next month:
"Characterizing Microblogs with Topic Models"
Daniel Ramage, Susan Dumais, Dan Liebling
