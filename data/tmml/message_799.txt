Hello Laura,
Thanks for your email. I am aware of the perplexity measure to estimate the
"goodness of fit" on the cross validation set.
But from a representation perspective, is it not intuitive to expect that
the LDA model is only a smoothed model of the Unigram representation.
at least for those words that occur in the document, the ML estimate from
the LDA should not contradict this evidence.
Your inputs are greatly appreciated.
Regards,
Shivani
