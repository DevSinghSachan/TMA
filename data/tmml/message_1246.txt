Hi everyone,
I have a question here: if we directly use LDA to a non-text data set,
does the result still meaningful? That is to say when the feature space
of the data set is not a vocabulary, can the relationship among the
features be found as well? If it works, then the dimensional reduction
through LDA becomes meaningful for those data sets with a high
dimensional feature space.
By the way, can anyone introduce some data sets normally preprocessed
for LDA?
Regards,
Peng
