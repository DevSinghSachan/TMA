Could you give a little more information about your setup? What
hyperparameters are you using? What kind of image features are you
using? How many "words" are there per image? What kinds of images are
in your database?
It's possible that the ideal number of topics is less than 20, or that
the variational lower bound is loose, but I suspect something else is
going on.
Best,
