Dear Rahul and others: Topic models are fascinating and important
scientifically, but generally speaking, they are not the most accurate
method for collaborative filtering, i.e. for predicting ratings in a
scenario like the one you describe. Matrix factorization methods tend
to be the most accurate, and much easier to implement. For practical
applications, the original method of Simon Funk (now five years old!)
is still an excellent place to start:

For slightly higher accuracy, see for example

http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/48/27/47/PDF/immmf.pdf
In your application, the most important influence on usefulness will
be the heuristic that you use to define ratings, since these are
pseudo ratings and not actual evaluations from users. It might be
preferable to predict the number of plays and skips directly. The LFL
method described in the first paper whose link is above can do this.
Best wishes, Charles Elkan
