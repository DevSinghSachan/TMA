Hi modelers,
Now that the major summer ML and NLP conferences have sent out
acceptances, I'd like to update the topic model bibliography. Please
send me either bibtex or better yet the XML format I use
(http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mimno/topicbib.xml), and I'll try to add
as many as I can.
Papers I've missed from previous years are welcome too, as are
implementations and tutorials.
