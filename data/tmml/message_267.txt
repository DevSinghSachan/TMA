Dear topic model experts,
has anyone experience got with real-world data on a mean-field approach
to models with dependent latent variables? I think of models like
pachinko allocation or the author-topic model that, in a Gibbs setting,
would require blocked sampling.
I am wondering whether it is viable to "consequently" follow the mean
field approach and drop dependencies in the variational distribution
between latent variables (the z's etc.) as well as between the
associated parameters (the theta's etc.) and train them implicitly in
the variational bound.
Thanks in advance for hints and opinions
