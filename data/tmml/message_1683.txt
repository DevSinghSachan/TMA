Dr. Blei,
Actually I am aware of this code and was instead looking for the actual
variational EM implementation that the paper adopted. Jonathan Chang told me
that only the gibbs sampling version is out in public because of its
effectiveness. But it would be cool if I can get hold of the actual
optimization wrt the scaling and smoothing parameters for different link
functions that was attempted in the paper. I need that for my own research
and want to see how nicely that part scales and how accurately it performs.
Thanks,
