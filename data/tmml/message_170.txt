Dear David Mimno,
Thanks very much for your reply.
Actually I made a mistake. I should not write on the order of the
vocabulary size
since the data is very sparse. As Prof. David Blei shown, the computational
complexity of VEM LDA is O(NKVz) if we consider the sparsity of the
co-occurrance.
You give me a very smart way to speed up GS LDA if data are dense. I will study
this. Thanks very much for your answer.
Best regards,
Yangqiu.
