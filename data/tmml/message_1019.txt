Dear list members,
I'm currently working with a student on a formal framework for
evaluating topic models using WordNet. For validation purpose, we need
some nice candidates to help us judging hundreds of word sets,
similarly to the evaluation used in the paper "Reading tea leaves: how
humans interpret topic models" (http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/docs/nips2009-rtl.pdf
). There will be at least two datasets: one on very general subjects,
and the second on specific subjects in economics.
If you're interested, please contact me as soon as possible. Contrary
to the paper of Chang et al., the job is not paid :(. Consider that
this is for science's sake :-).
Julien
