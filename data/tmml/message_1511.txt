Dear all,
An update on my issue with deep trees. It turns out that the program was not compiling correctly on my machine, hence the inference wasn't begin performed properly.
In short: On my machine (OSX 10.6.5) the hlda-c Makefile was causing the wrong 'time.h' to be included in the compilation, meaning that init_random_number_generator() wasn't being initialised properly.
To solve this problem, I removed '-I/usr/include/sys/' from line 9 of the Makefile, and it now compiles fine and learns deep trees. I was able to repeat this problem on another OSX machine, so I suspect the issue is a generic Macintosh one.
Thanks,
Michael
