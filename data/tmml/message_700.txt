The ICML 2010 Topic Models Workshop will take place on Friday, June 25 in
Haifa, Israel.
Workshop website: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amitg/topic_models_icml10.html
We encourage original submissions including, but not limited to:
Applications that build upon topics models: We encourage works that use
topic models for applications such as document summarization,
classification, annotation, machine translation, search, and more.
Thorough evaluation of topic models: Recent papers have shown that existing
evaluation techniques are insufficient. We are interested in evaluation
methodologies for topic models both with respect to other topic models and
non-topic model methods.
Applying topic models to structured corpora and incorporating additional
features into topic models: Considering the inner structure of a corpus may
lead to enhanced analysis capabilities. Examples include the use of
authorship information, the study of temporal changes and network models.
Exploration of topic models in new domains: Recently topic models have been
applied to problems in computational biology, collaborative filtering and
more. It would be interesting to explore even further the applicability of
these models.
Approximate inference for topic models: Exact inference in hierarchical
topic models is intractable and researchers resort to approximate methods.
We welcome introduction of new approximate inference methods as well as
further investigation and evaluation of existing methods, their extensions
and combination.
