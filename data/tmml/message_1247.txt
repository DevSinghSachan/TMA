LDA has been applied to a wide variety of problems ranging from image
recognition to microarray experimental data. As long as the generative
story makes some sense for your data it seems like a reasonable thing
to try. My favorite use of it has to be this paper by David Mimno:
Reconstructing Pompeian Households David Mimno. Applications of Topic
Models Workshop, NIPS 2009, Whistler, BC.

In this paper he looks at artifact data from the ruins of Pompeii,
treating rooms as 'documents' and artifacts as 'words'.
