Hey everyone,
The dinner will be on Tuesday (Dec 9) at 6pm at Kirin Restaurant which
is at 102-1166 Alberni Street. The reservation is under the name
Hanna. If you replied either to me or to the list saying you wanted to
come along, then you've been included in the head count. Plus there
should be sufficient room for another 7 or so people to join us.
