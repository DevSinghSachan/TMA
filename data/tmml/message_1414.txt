I am learning non parameter topic model by reading the follow paper:
Y. Teh, M. Jordan, M. Beal, and D. Blei. *Hierarchical Dirichlet processes*.
Journal of the American Statistical Association, 2006. 101[476]:1566-1581
And I find a simple implement of non parameter topic model in MALLET
toolkit : mallet-2.0.7-RC1.zip.
i run this code 100 times. The results of number of topic  in each time are
different.
My question is :
the  number of topic  in each running result are  different. Is that true?
