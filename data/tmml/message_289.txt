Hi list,
I was trying these days to implement hLDA (by the way, is there any
implementation available?) and I have some difficulties:
In the second markov chain, where the path assignments are sampled (c_m),
how do we calculate p(c_m | c_-m) ? According to the paper, this is implied
by the CRP prior,
but unfortunately it is not obvious to me how to use the CRP of Eq.(1) to
calculate this prob.
One more question: The paper says that c_m must be drawn as a block. This
means that for each document
we calculate c_m for all levels and then we move to the next document?
Thanks!
Regards,
ilias.
