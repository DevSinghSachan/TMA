Not integrating \phi out is certainly one potential approach.  But in
our distributed LDA method we get the advantages of collapsing, and it
always worked well in practice despite no theoretical guarantees.
Thousands of experiments showed that distributed LDA produced
indistinguishable test data perplexity results as LDA.
