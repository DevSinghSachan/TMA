dear ilias and all,
each c_m is a vector of table assignments drawn from a nested chinese
restaurant process.  the distribution p(c_m | c_{-m}) can be computed
as follows. first, use the other drawn paths (c_{-m}) to populate the
hierarchy.  then, compute the probability of each possible path
through the hierarchy, including paths that contain new tables at one
or more levels.
by "drawn as a block," we mean that all levels are drawn at once from
this distribution.  specifically, this is a distribution over paths,
where the number of paths is equal to the number of nodes in the
hierarchy.  each leaf corresponds to a path ending in that leaf.  each
internal node corresponds to a path with new nodes below it.
i hope this helps.
best,
dave
