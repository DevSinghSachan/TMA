ok, on closer scrutiny, I found why Ben recommended variance of
unconditional p(w).  This is to take care of topic mixing proportions, i.e.,
the \theta matrix in plate notation.
But if that's the only concern, then a simpler (but coarser) solution might
be to use a weighted variance instead of a simple variance:

Where the weights are either 1/avg_over_d(P(z|d)) or the corresponding
inverse log-likelihood.
