Also, does anyone know how number of topics tends to influence convergence
rate of Gibbs sampling or other iterative inference methods, all else equal?
Is there a soundly-established reason to believe that the likelihood of a
model with set number of inference iterations done is directly comparable to
the likelihood of another one with a different number of topics but run for
the same number of iterations? Or is there a way of relating the two
likelihoods?
