Hi, all
I am looking for a twitter dataset with respect to both the 'following'
relations and tweets content.
I downloaded the Stanford twitter dataset and KAIST's twitter data (
http://an.kaist.ac.kr/traces/WWW2010.html), however, the former only
contains contexts of tweets while the latter one only contains social
relations among twitters. Is there any dataset containing both relations and
contexts of tweets?
Thanks
Zach.
