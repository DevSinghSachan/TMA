I am not sure about the HMM/LDA combination model you suggest, but
there definitely is more related work on modeling the temporal trends
in text data with topic models.  Perhaps  one of these papers could be
helpful:
* Zhang, J. and Song, Y. and Zhang, C. and Liu, S., Evolutionary
hierarchical Dirichlet processes for multiple correlated time-varying
corpora, 2010
* Blei, D.M. and McAuliffe, J.D., Supervised topic models, 2010
* Rao, V. and Teh, Y.W., Spatial normalized gamma processes, 2009
* Mimno, D. and McCallum, A., Topic models conditioned on arbitrary
features with dirichlet-multinomial regression, 2008
