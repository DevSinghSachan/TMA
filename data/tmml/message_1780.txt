The goal is to predict tracks that the user has not rated to but is likely to like. So, it seems URP is the right choice.
I am looking at gibbs sampling right now. Once I implement the algorithm, I would analyse the results for different K (no. of latent topics) and compare the results.
I will look into Marlin's thesis for further details.
Could you please explain what you mean by "recall of recommendations"? I will take a look at Probabilistic matrix factorisation as well (don't know right now what it is about).
Thanks for your time and willingness to share the code. It would be of great help to me.
Thanks again
Rahul
