Hello all,
I'm posting for the first time. I'm keen to use the CTM
algorithm, and need to understand the difference between the routine
that's been coded and the algorithm set out in the paper (A CORRELATED
TOPIC MODEL FOR SCIENCE, Blei and Lafferty, 2007). I've run the coded
routine on some simulated data (100 documents, K = 5 topics); and I find
that while the variational parameters $lamdda$ and $nu^2$ are
effectively K-1 dimensional --- the K-th column of final-lambda.dat has
all zeroes, and the K-th column of final-nu.dat likewise --- there seem
to be K different topics.
Since the topics derive from the variational
parameters $phi$ in the paper, it's natural to suppose that, for each
word $w_n$ in a document $,W_{1:N}$ now, a K-dimensional vector
$phi_n =
(phi_{n,1},phi_{n,2}, ... ,phi_{n,K}$
is being estimated at the E-stage
of each EM-step. So I'm wondering if a $lambda_K$ and $nu^2_K$ are being
estimated as well: or is the K-th topic obtained at the very end,
somehow, after the routine has estimated K-1 topics in the manner set
out in the paper ?
Thanks much,
Hans Varghese Mathews
