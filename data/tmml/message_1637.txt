dear siddarth
to derive this form, begin with the data generating distribution
x ~ N(\mu, 1/\sigma^2)
and put it into the natural exponential family form. (note we parameterize with the precision rather than the variance.)
exp(\eta^T t(x) - a(\eta)).
then write down the conjugate prior (without its log normalizer) and note the form of the sufficient statistics.
next, take the product of gamma & gaussian and put it into the natural exponential family form. this should have the same sufficient statistics as the derived conjugate prior above.
best, dave
