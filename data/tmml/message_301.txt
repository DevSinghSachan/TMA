Dear list,
I have a question about David Blei's implementation of LDA variational
inference in lda-c. The code seems different from the algorithm in the
LDA paper (Blei et al. 2003).
According to the algorithm described in paper's Figure 6, the
Dirichlet update is:
\gamma^{t+1} = \alpha + \sum_{n=1}^N {\phi_n^{t+1}}.
but in the lda-c, the procedure is coded like this (function lda_inference):
for n = 1 to doc_length
for i = 1 to topic_num
update \phi_{ni} ...
\gamma_i^{t+1} = \gamma_i^t + count[w_n] *
(\phi_{ni} - \phi_{ni})
This means the update of \gamma is:
\gamma_i^{t+1} - \gamma_i^t = \sum_n {count-of-word_n *
\phi_{ni}^{t+1} - \phi_{ni}^t}
It is very different from the update in the paper. What is the reason
of using this rather than the one in the paper, and how can this be
correct?
Thanks in advance and best regards,
Chao
