hi all,
another solution worth mentioning is full variational posterior
inference on the topics as well as topic proportions and topic
assignments.
that is, rather than computing the MLE of the topic distributions
over words, compute variational approximations to them under a
dirichlet prior (as in the gibbs sampling set up).
i've found that this helps matters, particularly with smaller corpora.
best,
dave
