Quoting Matt Hoffman <mdhoffma at cs.princeton.edu>:
Thanks! I'm guessing all of this magic works out of the box on Debian
Linux and Debian descendants like Ubuntu (anything that uses "apt-get"
and has ".deb" packages). I run openSUSE, which is RPM-based. ATLAS is
in the repositories but I don't know about integration.
