Hello,
Recently I am reading the "Unsupervised Prediction of Citation Influences"
by Laura Dietz, Steffen Bickel, and Tobias Scheffer.
I don't quite understand the derivation from Equation (12) to Equation (13),
and the derivation of the denominator of equation (14).
Could somebody help explain/elaborate a little bit more?
Thanks.
Huiping
