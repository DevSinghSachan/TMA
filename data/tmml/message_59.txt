Folks,
All the theory behind topic modeling is foreign science to me given
my single year of college. Are there particular books that you would
recommend that would bring me up to par?
I imagine I'll need a few college courses worth of books but learning
is my greatest strength and I do have some money to spare. My biggest
trouble is translating the math notation into code.
I already bought a few books from Amazon, starting with the basics:
Probability demistified: A self-teaching guide.
