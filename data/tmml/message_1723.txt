Dave and David,
[sorry for the resend - accidentally sent as HTML the first time]
Most grateful for pointing me to your paper on posterior predictive
checking for topic models - it is quite provocative.
Two clarifications regarding your paper:
1. 'H' as a notational convention - I am not familiar with the
notational convention 'H' you use in equation #2 on page 4? What does it
signify?
2. Document labels - You make numerous references to tokens and
words, which I interpret as synonymous. But near the end of page 4 you
start to also refer to 'document labels'. Do you intend this as a third
synonym to words and tokens? If not, could you clarify what you are
referring to?
