hi laura and all,
along the same lines, i've had good luck with trimming terms that
occur in many documents.  these are essentially stop words.
a good method for selecting the vocabulary is to
(a) remove terms occurring in fewer than 0.1% of all documents
(b) remove terms occurring in more than 90% of all documents
criterion (a)  will trim the vocabulary.
criterion (b) will not, but if you are using gibbs sampling then it
will save time during inference.  the reason is that a topic
assignment must be sampled for each instance of each term and the
terms trimmed in (b) tend to be very frequent.  there won't be as
marked a difference if using variational methods because the within-
document word count does not affect their complexity.
there have been a number of recent papers on speeding up gibbs
sampling for LDA, as others have pointed out.  variational methods are
easy to parallelize.
best,
dave
