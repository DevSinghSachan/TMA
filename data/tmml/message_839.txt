Hi Alfred,
the best way is to diagnose at which iteration the chain converged (i.e.
reached the ergodic distribution), then you let the chain run for some
more iterations and pick the one solution that reached the maximum
likelihood. (*)
So this is actually the same question as Lucas asked.
Cheers,
Laura
(*) actually this is a hack. According to MCMC you would have so average
several the solutions of the chain from the ergodic part, however this
might not give good results on LDA because of the unifentifiability problem.
