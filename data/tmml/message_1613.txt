Hi Xueliang,
You can check out Project Apache Mahout. It builds on top of hadoop and
it is a scalable machine learning library. It has latent dirichlet
allocation implemented although it was a student project and I am not
100% sure of its performance but you should still check it out. You
should also check out Yahoo's implementation of LDA which many claim is
much better than what's available in Mahout.
