Topic Modelers,
For those looking for interesting stories of latent topic models, we have
a new paper at ECML using them for program debugging.  There are two main
ideas:
1. By inserting probes into software code, we log the execution trace of
the software by the activation counts of all probes.  In this way, a
single execution of the software is a "document" in a bag-of-word
representation, where the word-types are the distinct probes, and each
word-token is an activation of a probe.  By sending the instrumented
software to a large number of users, we collect a corpus of such
documents.  We know which documents succeeded and which failed (crashed).
2. We model failed documents with a mixture of 'bug topics' and 'usage
topics' -- the latter capture how people use the software (open a file,
print a page, etc.).  We model successful documents with only the usage
topics.  This joint modeling forces the bug topics to explain the
differences between successful and failed documents.  It allows us to
capture subtle bugs, which tend to be weak and otherwise would be
overwhelmed by the usage counts.
