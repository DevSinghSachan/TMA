Hi all!
For my 1st post, I would like to let you know that I recently made public a
Perl implementation of the LDA topic model.
You may find it at http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ptoulis/
It is currently at an early state, so any comments/suggestions and more
importantly bug reports are warmly welcome!
Best,
Panos
