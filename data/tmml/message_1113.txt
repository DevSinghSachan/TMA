Nice, way to take the philosophical tone up a notch.
An LDA "topic" is a distribution over a vocabulary that assigns high
probability to a set of words that tend to appear in the same
documents. It so happens that words that tend to cooccur in the same
documents tend to have something to do with one another. When people
look at a list of a bunch of words that have something to do with one
another, they're pretty good at figuring out what that something is,
and they say something like "these are words about business" or "these
are words about chemistry." Since business and chemistry are topics
(insofar as topics are things documents can be about), we say that LDA
has discovered a business topic or a chemistry topic.
None of this means that when (for example) a comparative literature
professor uses the word "topic" he or she really means "a distribution
over a vocabulary of words." All it means is that topic models produce
distributions over vocabularies that human beings tend to interpret as
being related to specific topics, regardless of what a "topic"
actually is.
