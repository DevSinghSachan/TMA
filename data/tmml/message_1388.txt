Hi, all. I'm using Collapsed Gibbs sampling to implent GM-LDA for image annotation. I have some questions, could anyone help me?
When estimating, how to estimate theta is more reasonable, right now I compute as follows:
theta[m][k]  = (nd[m][k] + alpha ) / (ndsum[m] + K * alpha );
theta[m][k] *= ( nd_vis[m][k] + alpha ) / ( ndsum_vis[m] + K * alpha );
Is that right?
When infer annotations for a new image, I could compute z_v from visual features from the image, then:
(1) comput theta using visual features statistics, is that right?
(2) How to compute z_w (topic of annotation words) for the new image.
Can anyone help me or recommand some related papers, thank you very much.
