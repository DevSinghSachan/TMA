Hi,
I'm running the vanilla LDA from the 2003 LDA paper, and am running into
problems with the computation of the likelihood bound from Equation 15.  The
computation of gammaln(var_gamma) , where var_gamma is the variational gamma
hyperparameter, is giving me infinity.  i've checked the value of the phi
variable from which var_gamma is estimated, and it seems normal (6220 rows,
each row sums to 1), and can't seem to figure out what is wrong here, any
help  or insight is appreciated..
Thanks!
Brian
