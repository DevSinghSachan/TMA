Hi Hal,
This looks great!
It looks like the Maths and Random classes in Mallet provide most of the
same functions as stats.c. Take a look here:

I've actually found that if you write C-like code in java, the speed
difference is insignificant. (Specifically, avoid object references and
random access to multi-dimensional arrays in the innermost loops --
indexing the topic-word counts as [word][topic] instead of the other way
around makes a huge difference)
