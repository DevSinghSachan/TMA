Hi,
In my master thesis I am working on a news recommendation system. Right now
I am implementing a really basic version which is based on TF-IDF and
centroid based classification.
During my research I stumbled upon LDA again and again in different fields.
However, one thing did not clear up for me and I hope you can help me. I am
sure it was asked before but I just couldn't find the answer.
So here is what I understood:
LDA is learned on a document training set to generate topics. This is
basically some kind of clustering.
LDA can then be used to describe a new unknown document in terms of these
topics.
Now I am unsure about the following: Can I use this description as a
feature vector and use it with common classifiers such as k-NN, SVM and
Naive Bayes? Also: Can I just use the cosine metric to compare two
documents?
Additionally I think what brings up my confusion is that LDA can be used on
many levels as I understood:
- as a feature generator
- as a classifier
- for collaborative filtering
Did I get this right? I am happy for every answer.
Btw. I studied Philosophy with a focus on Speech Philosophy and found that
the idea of topics relates pretty well to some speech concepts. I don't
know if anybody did some research on that but it would be really useful to
understand topic models on a different level.
Anyways: thanks in advance,
Karsten
