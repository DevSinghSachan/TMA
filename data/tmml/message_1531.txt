Hello!
So far I mainly used Gibbs sampling for the inference of topic models.
There, I chose ~2,500 iterations for my data set. Now I want to use a
different model whose inference is done based on Variational Bayes. Can
someone give me a hint what would be a comparable number of iterations
for this inference method, is it related?
Best regards,
Sebastian
