Hi, I think it's a common misconception that generality has anything to do
with frequency.  If I have a word "196295", it might have a frequency of 5,
such that, it might be very specific.  However, instead it might occur in
many different topics (and thus each use may be completely unrelated and
entirely coincidental).
I found some better examples:  "football" and "British" may have nearly
identical frequency, but football may be more topically specific than
British.
The measure of generality I'm looking for, would not have any correlation
with frequency.  Thereby, low-frequency words could just as easily be more
general, and high-frequency words could be fairly specific.  "George Bush"
might be high frequency but also quite specific.
