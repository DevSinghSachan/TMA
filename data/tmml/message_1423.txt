Dear List members,
I am just a starter in the LDA. Now I am reading the source code of
Gibbs-sampling based LDA such as JavaGibbsLDA [1] and [2].
I found a little bit confused when I looked at the following section
of the code on picking the topic index after Gibbs Sampling, i.e.,
calculating p(z_i|z_-i, w).
// cumulate multinomial parameters
for (int k = 1; k < p.length; k++) {
p[k] += p[k - 1];
// scaled sample because of unnormalised p[]
double u = Math.random() * p[K - 1];
for (topic = 0; topic < p.length; topic++) {
if (u < p[topic])
break;
Would somebody like to help me on understanding these two sectons? Why
calculate the cumulative parameters after the gibbs sampling? How to
you choose the Topic index from those z_i to z_k for a term w_n?
Thanks very much for your time and help!
Regards,
Henry
