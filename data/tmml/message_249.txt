Hi once again --
I quickly verified that the Bayesian approach I suggested yesterday
works. The remaining challenge is the parametrisation of the adaptive
rejection sampler (Wally Gilks' implementation, and I've put a Java port
online...) and the Gamma prior parameters. Sometimes for low alpha or
too small data sizes, sampling fails and tiny values are sampled.
Best,
gregor
