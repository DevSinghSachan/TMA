Bearing in mind the view that LDA and related models effect a form of
non-negative matrix factorization on the document x term frequency
matrix, one might try a form of independent component analysis on that
matrix instead, e.g. one that minimizes the mutual information among
the source components.  Hopefully that's conceptually satisfying to
you.  There was a scheme tested on the NIH's Pubmed database by an
internal effort there that did something like that with keyword groups
serving as the components of the corpus.  The algorithm was more
combinatorial than probabilistic in character though, if I remember
correctly.  I can pass along a reference a bit later.
