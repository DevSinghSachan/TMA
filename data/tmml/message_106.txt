Hi Dave,
After thinking a bit and talking with Wei Li this afternoon, I think I can
rephrase it as two questions:
First, for a given path and level there's a multinomial (beta) drawn from
a dirichlet (eta), and some number of word counts (split in the notation
between n_{c_{m,l}, -m} and n_{c_{m,l}, m}) drawn from the multinomial. I
get:
Gamma(W eta)     prod_w(Gamma (eta + n^w_{-m} + n^w_{m}))
prod_w(Gamma eta)      Gamma(W eta + n_{-m} + n_{m}))
rather than the version in the paper, which includes the {-m} counts in
the first term. Am I missing something?
The second question may be a notational confusion. My understanding from
the paper is that all the documents choose a path based on their current
topic assignments. In other words, at the point where a document picks a
new path, all of its words are assigned to topics on the path it chose in
the previous iteration.
When constructing the sampling distribution over paths, consider a path
that diverges from the current path at the root. For all the levels on
this path other than the root, n_{c_{m,l}, m} is 0 since all the words are
assigned to levels on the current path. This raises two problems. First,
as printed, the term for a level with no words assigned to it is 1, where
for a level on the current path (where n_{m} > 0), it's somewhere around
exp(-1000), so the current path will never be sampled. Second, it means
that the sampling distribution for paths other than the current path
doesn't really take into account the words in the document, since none of
them will be assigned to any node in the tree off the current path.
To take a really simple example, say the tree has two levels and there are
10 paths from the root -- I'll call the nodes R and 1..10. The current
document is assigned to path 1, so all of its words are either assigned to
R or to 1. Now when I consider the path R->2, I can absorb any factors
