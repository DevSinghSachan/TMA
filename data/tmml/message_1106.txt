Hi -- the reason for this is complexity, as explained in Dave Blei's JMLR
article. PLSA is "just" learning the associations using empirical distributions.
For LDA, the "relaxation" to the lower bound in variational EM is the analogon
to this. There have been several evaluations comparing several methods (e.g.,
Ascuncion et al. 2009, UAI), and I think also some results were presented at the
NIPS conference. Laplace and higher-order variational may indeed be nice to have
in a comparison.
