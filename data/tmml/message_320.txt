A postdoctoral research position is available at UC Irvine in the area
of statistical text modeling, with a focus on topic modeling. The
project will involve investigating and developing new types
of topic models and evaluating performance on large corpora.
The ideal candidate will have knowledge of both Bayesian learning
methods and text modeling, and prior experience in working with
Bayesian computational methods such as MCMC techniques.
The starting date can be as early as May - the initial funding
for this project is for 1 year - but it is likely that funding
will be available in addition for a 2nd year. The investigators
on this project are Professor Mark Steyvers (msteyver at uci.edu
<mailto:steyvers at uci.edu>)
and Professor Padhraic Smyth (smyth at ics.uci.edu
<mailto:smyth at ics.uci.edu>) - please
contact either if interested and would like further information.
