dear chao,
in the LDA paper, we treat each instance of a word as a separate
variable.  however, the phi updates for words that correspond to the
same term---e.g., a document that contains 5 instances of the word
"peanut"---will be the same.  so, we need only compute the phi update
for "peanut" once.
the subsequent gamma update, which is a sum of all the phis, becomes a
sum of the phis for each unique term multiplied by their counts.
\gamma = \sum_{unique terms} \phi_i * n_i
where n_i is the number of times we saw the ith term.
i hope this clears things up.
best,
dave
