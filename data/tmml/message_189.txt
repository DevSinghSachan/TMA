You might look at a text on Bayesian mixture models, such as chapter 18 of
Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al., or chapter six of Bayesian Core.
LDA is a mixture model in which the component distributions f_m(y_i |
theta_m) are multinomials, while in the GMM they are Gaussians. BDA
describes the Gaussian case, but not the multinomial case, so you'd still
have to formally describe LDA as a mixture model, but that shouldn't be
too hard.
