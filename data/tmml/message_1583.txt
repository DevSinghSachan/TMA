Hello,
Because of the logistic function, the topic parameters (\eta) can be
shifted by an arbitrary amount with the same proportions ( exp( \nu_i
+ c )/\sum_j exp( \nu_j + c ) = exp( \nu_i )/\sum_j exp( \nu_j ) ) .
So, without loss of generality, the Kth topic parameter is set to 0,
and all other parameters are relative to it. After estimating the
topic proportions of the K-1 topics at the very end, you can find the
proportion of the Kth topic using 1 - \sum_{i=0}^{K-1} \theta_i. I
hope that helps?
Cheers,
