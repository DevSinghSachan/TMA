Hi,
Is there a good testing data for LDA (set of articles and vocabulary) to
just see how LDA works?
I used NIPS articles for this purpose (~1800 documents) but top words for
each topic are not so nice e.g. some words appear in all topics ("neural",
"system", "network").
In other words observing top words for each topic it's difficult to
determine a real topic e.g. words "linear", "vector", "matrix",
"eigenvalue" - it's linear algeabra but I have not seen such "nice" top
words in my experiments.
So another question: how to get a "good"  training data  (not very
large) for experiments with LDA like models?
Thannks, Vasiliy.
