hi,
Not very proficient with Java (none C), downloaded the LDA-J port and tried
in eclipse.
1) Can you explain what the output (I ran for 'ap' data) means?
2) What part of the package/program did the 'ap-topics.pdf' (the discovery
of topic list) got generated? Which is what I ultimately should be able to
produce, the topics discovery.
3) Anyone can provide code (Java) for preparing the document in SVMLight
format?
Appreciate your help.
Regards
Rao
