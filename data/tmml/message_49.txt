Joel,
The answer is easy: It depends on your data and the kind of answer you
want to get.
(This is the usual problem of choosing the right hyperparameters in a
parametric setting :)
alpha should be between 0 and 1, the closer to 0 it is, the less aspects
you get in your topic mix
k (the number of topics) depends on the granularity of topics you want
to get
if you try several different alpha and k values, you should use
something like
alpha = constant / k
to be able to compare the different models (griffiths and steyvers
recommend something like alpha = 50/k as a starting point, but you have
to make sure that alpha stays below 1)
You can also try to learn the alphas with a maximum likelihood II approach.
Hope this helps,
Laura
