Hi Mark and all,
As I understand, the original LDA text generative model did indeed account
for document length. In the original paper on LDA it is stated that the
document lengths can be generated from the Poisson distribution. I think
that another reasonable prior for the document length would be Weibull
distribution. However, in the same original paper on LDA Dave Blei says:
"Furthermore, note that N is independent of all the other data generating
variables (q and z). It is thus an ancillary variable and we will generally
ignore its randomness in the subsequent development." Hence ignore is what
all the other authors do after that. But for me, if we ignore the process of
document length generation, then we don't have a generative model
anymore. Can anyone shed more light on the original idea to ignore the
document size?
Thanks,
Andrey
