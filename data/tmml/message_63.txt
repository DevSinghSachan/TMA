hi topic models mailing list,
many of you have asked for an implementation of the correlated topic
model (CTM) from blei and lafferty (2006).  (a longer version of that
paper will soon be published in the annals of applied statistics.)
we have released our code for the CTM, which can be found here:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/ctm-c/index.html
you may also be interested in the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)
code, which is here:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/index.html
i hope that many of you find this useful.  have fun!
best,
dave
