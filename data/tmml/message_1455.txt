Hi, all,
It is known that original LDA doesn't consider temporal trend in data.
Later, extension are made to cover this point. I know two works, David M. Blei's Dynamic Topic Models and Xuerui Wang's Topics over Time.
Dynamic Topic Models separate data into time slices, then model the documents of each slice with one topic model, then chain the parameters together.
Topics over Time however doesn't discretize  time into slices. Instead, it models time jointly with word co-occurrence patterns. Graphically,  a new node is added to the original LDA plate notation.
As a natural model for model state change in time series, Hidden Markov Model is a suitable for model topic trend through the documents. Unfortunately, it seems not much work pay attention to this.
So my question is: Is it possible to combine HMM with LDA to model the topic trend through different documents?
Best,
Charly
