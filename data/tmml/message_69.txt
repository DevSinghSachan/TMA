Yes, we showed this in eq.10-12 in our paper, where "updates for
dirichlet parameters
built into the objective function" is made explicit and corresponds to
modelling q(phi,theta|z) exactly.
I think the log asymptotes to a value that is a constant larger than
the digamma.  The difference between the two updates is indeed quite
small, but we have found that the collapsed version is significantly
more accurate.  I think this is a result of the different behaviours
for small values of x.  For x < .5, the digamma goes to -inf much
faster than the log.  This means that the uncollapsed version is more
"conservative" when the counts are small.
If what you meant is the uncollapsed variational bound evaluated at
the CVI solution better than the uncollapsed bound evaluated at the VB
solution, I think not, unless due to local minima.  If what you meant
is the uncollapsed bound evalated at the CVI solution better than the
collapsed bound evaluated at the CVI solution, then no: the converse
is given in eq.13.
Em... we expanded the gamma identity and cancelled all terms except
the ones left on eq.15, that's about it...
