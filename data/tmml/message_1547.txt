Harry,
For what it's worth, you might want to try the correlated topic model
instead of (or in addition to) LDA.  Recall that the CTM assumes that topics
can be correlated -- or anticorrelated -- with one another (in LDA, they're
more independent).
This could help with sparsity (it gives you information about other genres
they like if you only know of one).  I also suspect that there's a lot of
correlation in music preferences.  For example, there's probably a
correlation between people who like hip-hop and r&b, just like there's a
correlation between people who like rock and heavy metal.
Cheers,
Sean
