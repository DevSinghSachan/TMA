hi all,
allison chaney has created the "topic model visualization engine," which can
be used to create browsers of document collections based on a topic model.
i think this will become a very useful tool for us.  the code is on google
code:

as an example, here is a browser built from a 50-topic model fit to 100K
articles from wikipedia:

allison describes how she built the browser in the README for her code:

finally, to check out the code and build your own browser, see here:

enjoy!
