hi avare,
these are \gamma_{d,k} from our JMLR paper about LDA.  these are the
sum of the dirichlet prior \alpha and expected counts of words for
each topic in each document.  to obtain mean topic proportions for
each document, renormalize each row to sum to one.
again using the notation from our JMLR paper, the word assignments are
\arg \max_{i} \phi_{n,i}
in other words, they assign each (unique) term in each document to its
most likely posterior topic.  these are useful when you'd like to
partition the terms of a document into the topics.
i hope this helps.
best,
dave
