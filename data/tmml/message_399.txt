In English: The word "belongs the most" to the topic that gives it the
highest probablity to occur. This >probability is different for topics
p,q,...
me all the other variables too. I think inference computes \theta too.
Actually the inference which is explained in paper(which you are mentioning
above) is part of the expectation atep. We are doing the variational
inferencing there. At the end of this we have the present values of the
variational parameters being estimated. estimation mentioned in the next
section is the maximization step of the EM. I feel the order is correct.
