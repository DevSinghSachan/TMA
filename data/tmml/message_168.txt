dear yangqiu,
thanks for your question.
the complexity of mean-field variational inference is actually
O(NKV).  the reason is that, in a document, we need not compute
posterior multinomials for each instance of each term but only once
for each unique term in that document.  in the LDA paper, we did not
write things down that way to make the math simpler.  (though, we
should have mentioned this speed-up.)
if you'll look at the LDA-C code, which is on my web-site, you'll see
that we only need to iterate through the unique terms of each document
for each iteration of variational inference.
i hope that this helps.
best,
dave
