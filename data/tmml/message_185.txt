Dear all:
I tried calling the function sample_term() to compute the true
log-likehood using the variational mean-field posterior as a proposal
distribution for importance sampler (in Prof. David Blei's CTM C code
downloaded from his website). However, I found that sometimes the true
likelihood obtained by importance sampling is lower than the
lower-bound of the log-likelihood (computed by lhood_bnd function).
I'm wondering if this is the problem with importance sampler?
Specifically, does this mean that the variational mean-field posterior
is not a good proposal distribution for importance sampling of the
true posterior distribution? If that's the case, how does one compute
the true log-likelihood.
thank you very much for your help.
