Just to add a touch more to what Sean has already pointed out.  Like
others, for some problems I've found a useful plan is to run some flavor
of topic analysis, followed by a characterization of the topic similarity.
Dendrograms and heatmaps are convenient for presenting the results.
problem.  On problems where the information is not coded as words and the
'documents' are short (2-10 tokens), I've found Hellinger to perform very
well. The additional 'clustering' provides great additional insight into
the problem.  For text and large average document size (10^{2-4}), I
recall that Jensen-Shannon was best (closely followed by Hellinger).  I
ran through a number of different distant measures for my type of data and
found Hellinger returned 'truth' significantly better than any other
method, YMMV.
FWIW - I worked with a colleague involved with topological mapping to try
to understand why certain measures performed better with different
problems and, the last time I was looked, there didn't seem to be a
consistent rule of thumb. My intuition is that Hellinger is a type of
spherical distance measure that 'pulls' points from the simplex onto the
unit sphere and that seems to help provide some additional fidelity.
Finally, the archives (2/27/11) contain a snippet of R code for Hellinger
