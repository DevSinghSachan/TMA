Hi, all:
The paper on term weight models with LDA
(http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/N/N10/N10-1070.pdf) is indeed intriguing,
in particular if IDF is used as a global weight.
Unfortunately, IDF presumes that the discriminatiory power of a term in a
query is unique an independent from other terms in the query or the
collection. This not always the case.
