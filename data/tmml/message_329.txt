Dear list,
I'd like to use LDA to tag words in test data with topics, as is shown
with the different colored words of Figure 8 in "Latent Dirichlet
Allocation".   Since 'lda inf' in the C implementation has no direct
output for this,  I had thought (perhaps naively) to compute
p(z|doc)p(w|z), estimating p(z|doc) by taking the gamma values output by
'lda inf' for the given document, subtracting alpha from each gamma to
obtain the expected number of words for that topic, then normalizing
these expectations by their sum to obtain a probability.    But perhaps
this is wrong, and I must use the phiN for this purpose?   Presumably I
would have to modify the C code so as to make it write these out.
I do see a word-assignments.dat file, but that is only for 'est'.
Apologies if this has already been covered in the past
thanks,
Dave
