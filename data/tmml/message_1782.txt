hi rahul,
if you have other observations about the items (like text or sound
features) then you may be able to adapt chong wang's algorithm in
"collaborative topic modeling for recommending scientific articles."
his algorithm works like matrix factorization when many users have
rated an item; it relies more on the other observations (text, in our
application) with sparsely rated items.
the paper is here:

a demo and code are here:

(i realize you originally asked about the user rating profile model.
however, i thought that you'd be interested in learning about this
algorithm and code.)
best
dave
