Hello,
I am confused about an aspect of the sLDA model.
It is said in (Blei, McAuliffe, 2007) that a response variable y for a
document is sampled from a normal distribution based on the generated
topic assignments to the words of the document. The respective normal
distribution gets parameterized by two values, namely (i) what seems to
me to be a scalar product of two vectors, ETA and Z^{bar} and (ii) by
BETA^{2}.
However, what confuses me is the given definition of Z^{bar} := (1/N) *
SUM_n=1:N {z_n}. By this definition, Z^{bar} is a scalar value, not a
vector!?
I hope someone can explain this to me.
Sebastian
